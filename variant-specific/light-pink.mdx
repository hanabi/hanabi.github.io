These conventions apply to any variant with a light pink (touched by all ranks and no colors) suit.

### Pink Conventions & White Conventions

- Light Pink "inherits" all of the [conventions for white cards](white.mdx) and all of the [conventions for pink cards](pink.mdx).
- Some specific clarifications are listed below.

### The Bubblegum Wraparound

- When players violate _Pink Promise_ on an unplayable light pink card, it usually indicates a _Bubblegum Prompt_ or a _Bubblegum Finesse_ (with the rank corresponding to the slot number to play).
- In 4-player and 5-player games, there are only 4 cards in the hand. If a player does a _Bubblegum Finesse_ with a 5, then that would be nonsensical, since there is no slot 5.
- Similarly, in a 6-player game, there are only 3 cards in the hand. If a player does a _Bubblegum Finesse_ with a 4, then that would be nonsensical, since there is no slot 4.
- In this situation, it should "wraparound" to slot 1, communicating that the first slot is playable.
- This kind of thing is useful in some edge-case scenarios (e.g. helping satisfy _Good Touch Principle_).
