# Specific Conventions for Prism

These conventions apply to any variant with a prism suit.

<br />

### Color Finesses (One-Away-From-Playable)

* For the purposes of *Finesses*, prism cards "match" every color (just like a rainbow suit "matches" every color).
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Prism 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues green to Cathy, touching a prism 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays a prism 2 from his *Finesse Position*.
  * Cathy knows that similar to rainbow, prism "matches" every color. Thus, since green matches green, this must be a *Finesse*.
  * Cathy plays her green as a prism 3.

### Color Finesses (Two-Away-From-Playable)

* Just like a normal *Finesse*, you can also perform a *Double Finesse* by giving a color clue to a prism card that is two-away-from-playable (or a *Triple Finesse* on a prism card that is three-away-from-playable).
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues green to Donald, touching a prism 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays a prism 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  * Cathy knows that this could either be a *Bluff* (on just the prism 1) or a *Double Finesse* (on both the prism 1 and the prism 2).
  * In this situation, Cathy knows that Donald will not go on to misplay his prism 3 as a prism 2.
  * However, Cathy knows that whether or not the clue receiver will misplay a card is irrelevant - all that matters is whether or not the clue matches the card that was blind-played. Thus, since green matches green, this communicates a *Double Finesse*.
  * Cathy blind-plays a prism 2 from her *Finesse Position*.
  * Donald plays his green card as a prism 3.
