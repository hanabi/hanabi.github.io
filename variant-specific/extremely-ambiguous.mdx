These conventions apply to the "Extremely Ambiguous" variants.

### Blue Color Clues

- A blue color clue means to play the _Second Finesse Position_ (as before the blue color clue was given).
- Players can also use blue to initiate a _Finesse_. For example:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues blue to Cathy.
  - Bob blind-plays slot 1 as sky 1.
  - Cathy plays slot 2 as sky 2.
- Blue color clues are only to be used as a last resort, meaning that if it is possibly to cleanly clue the Second Finesse Position with a number clue, then players must do so.
- Cards touched with blue do not count as being touched for the purposes of discarding, _Good Touch Principle_, and so forth.

### The Unnecessary Blue Bluff

- Since blue color clues are only to be used as a last resort, players can use them in situations that are unnecessary in order to communicate something extra.
- In a situation where a clean number clue was available and a blue color clue was used instead, the next player should blind-play their _Finesse Position_ card as a _Known Bluff_.
- The next player after that will assume that a _Finesse_ occurred. However, once they play their _Second Finesse Position_ card and see that it is an unrelated suit, then they will know that an _Unnecessary Blue Bluff_ occurred.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: sky 4, sky 1, sky 4, sky 3, sky 3
  - If Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, she could cleanly "get" the sky 1.
  - Instead, Alice clues blue to Cathy, touching all 5 cards in Cathy's hand. Cathy knows that this means that she can play her slot 2 card.
  - Bob sees that Cathy's blue clue was unnecessary, because a number 1 clue could have cleanly gotten the sky 1. Since blue clues are only to be used as a last resort, this must be an _Unnecessary Blue Bluff_.
  - Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card and it is a berry 1.
  - Cathy knows that a _Play Clue_ on slot 2 made Bob blind-play, so this must be a _Finesse_ and Cathy must have the berry 2 to connect to Bob's blind-play.
  - Cathy plays her slot 2 card as berry 2 and it is instead the sky 1. Cathy now knows that Alice performed an _Unnecessary Blue Bluff_.

### Advanced Conventions

- In Extremely Ambiguous variants, _Ejections_ and _Discharges_ work quite differently. See the [Specific Conventions for Variants with No Positive Clues](no-positive-clues.mdx).
