# Specific Conventions for Dark Null

These conventions apply to any variant with a dark null suit.

### Positional Layered Finesse Turned Off

* The *Positional Layered Finesse* is turned off. Another way of saying this is that players are allowed to perform a *Positional Clues* to get a non-null cards to play. After the first positional blind-play, no extra cards are promised.
* In general, players should prefer to use "normal" moves over *Positional Clues*, since they add extra confusion to the game. However, there might be a tricky situation in which a *Positional Clue* for a non-null card is necessary.
