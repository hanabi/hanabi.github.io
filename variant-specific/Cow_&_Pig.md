# Specific Conventions for Cow & Pig

These conventions apply to the "Cow & Pig" variants.

<br />

### No Color Saves

* Rank clues (oink) are always used to perform a *Save Clue*.
* Color clues (moo) must always be *Play Clues*.

### Reverse Finesse Restriction

* It is illegal to perform a *Reverse Finesse* with a rank clue on the first turn. (This makes things more clear for players when they are given a *Save Clue* and there are some playable cards on *Finesse Position* to get.)

### Advanced Conventions

* In Cow & Pig variants, *Ejections* and *Discharges* work quite differently. See the [Specific Conventions for Variants with No Positive Clues](No_Positive_Clues.md).
