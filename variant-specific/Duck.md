## Basic Conventions

### Chop Saves

* All clues to chop are treated as *Save Clues*.

### Relaxed 2 Saves

* It is optional for players to give *Save Clues* to 2's.
* Thus, if a 2 is discarded, players should not make any *Elimination Notes* for them.

### Inverted Tempo Clues

* Normally, if a *Save Clue* is given to two cards, and then the cards are re-touched, it is a *Double Tempo Clue* and both the cards should play from left to right, even if one of the cards was on chop.
* In Duck, the older card should play first. (This is exactly the same thing as the *[Brown Inversion](Brown.md#brown-inversion)* convention.)

### Loaded Play Clues

* *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned on" in Duck variants. Furthermore, *Loaded Play Clues* are even turned on in the *Early Game*.

### The Loaded Finesse

* In addition to the above rule, players are also not allowed to give a *Save Clue* to a someone if that someone has a playable card that could be clued instead.
* If the chop card is clued in this scenario, it is instead treated a *Chop-Focus Loaded Play Clue*. However, the player receiving the clue will not know this, and will treat it as a normal *Save Clue*. Thus, a *Loaded Play Clue* given in this scenario must be a *Loaded Finesse*.
* As an exception to the rule, players are allowed to give a *Save Clue* if the *Play Clue* would violate *Good Touch Principle*.

### The 1's Promise

* Players must use the number 1 clue to clue 1's in a player's opening hand.
* Thus, if a player gets a *Play Clue* that touches two cards, and then they play the left-most card and it is a 1, they can know that the other one is for-sure a 1 and should play it on the next turn.
* If 3 or more 1's were clued with the original clue, then the play order should be from left to right.

### The 1's Promise Play Lie

* Players can be tricked into playing cards by using the *1's Promise*. For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Alice clues Bob about two cards on slot 1 and slot 2.
  * Bob plays slot 1. It is a red 1.
  * Bob knows that because of the *1's Promise, the card on his slot 2 must also be a 1.
  * When it gets to Bob's turn, Bob plays his slot 2, and it is a red 2 instead of a 1.
* If there are additional cards in the hand that were touched by the original clue, then once the *1's Promise Play Lie* is revealed, players should stop playing those cards.
* For example, in 3-player game:
  * Alice clues Bob about three cards on slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  * Bob plays slot 1. It is a red 1.
  * Bob knows that because of the *1's Promise*, the cards on his slot 2 and slot 3 must also be a 1.
  * When it gets to Bob's turn, Bob plays his slot 2, and it is a red 2 instead of a 1.
  * Bob knows that his slot 3 card must be a red card. However, it is not necessarily the red 3, and is equally likely to be either a red 3, a red 4, or a red 5.

### The 1's Promise Play Lie Finesse

* It is also possible to *Finesse* other players by using the *1's Promise*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Alice clues Bob about two cards on slot 1 and slot 2.
  * Bob plays slot 1. It is a red 1.
  * Bob knows that because of the *1's Promise*, the card on his slot 2 must also be a 1.
  * Cathy sees that Bob was clued about a red 1 and a red 3 as a red clue. Cathy also sees that it was possible to give a "clean" number 1 clue to Bob to only get the red 1.
  * Cathy knows that Bob's clue choice was quite strange: because of the *1's Promise*, Bob will misplay the red 3 when it gets to his turn. Thus, this must be a *Finesse*.
  * Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* as red 2.

## Advanced Conventions

### The Duck Bluff (on a 5)

* Normally, you cannot perform a *Bluff* in Duck variants, because there is no way for the clue to not match the card that is blind-playing.
* However, the one exception to this is if a 5 blind-plays. Then, the clue receiver can know that it is a *Bluff* (because there is no card that matches at 5).
* In this situation, the clue receiver would mark their touched card as either a one-away card (as a normal *Bluff*) or a 3 (as a *3 Bluff*).

### The Duck Double Bluff

* *3 Bluffs* are "turned off" in this variant, for obvious reasons.
* This means that players can use the *Double Bluff* convention much more often by giving *Play Clues* to two-away from playable 3's. After seeing two unrelated blind-plays occur, the receiver of the clue will know that their card is two-away from playable. (This takes precedence over more complicated things, like *Layered Finesses*.)
  * Note that it is also possible to *Double Bluff* by cluing two-away 4's and two-away 5's, but that can be done in any variant.
* *Double Half-Bluffs* are explicitly outlawed. In other words, the first blind-play from a *Double Bluff* must be completely unrelated to the card that was clued.

### 5 Ejection

* *5 Color Ejection* is turned on in Duck variants, as you would expect.
* Additionally, players can also perform *5 Number Ejection* and it will generally work in the exact same way.
* Thus, players should keep in mind that clues that cause *Ejection* might have been either a color clue or a number clue.

### 4 Charm

* *Charm* is defined as a move that makes a player play their *Fourth Finesse Position*.
* Similar to *5 Ejection*, if a player gives a *Play Clue* to an unplayable 4 that would require two or more blind-plays in order to fulfill the *Finesse*, then a *Finesse* is unlikely.
* Players agree that this communicates a *Charm*.
* Similar to *5 Ejection*, *4 Charm* can be initiated with either a color clue or a number clue.

### The Double Play Bluff

* Normally, when a playable card is clued again, it is interpreted as an *Double Play Ejection* on the very next player.
* However, in the *Duck* variants, it instead means to play slot 1 as a *Known Bluff*.
