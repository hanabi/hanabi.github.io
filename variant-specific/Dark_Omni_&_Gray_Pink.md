# Specific Conventions for Dark Omni & Gray Pink

These conventions apply to any variant with a dark omni suit or a gray pink suit.

<br />

### Inheritance

- Dark Omni "inherits" all of the conventions for black cards and all of the conventions for omni cards.
- Gray Pink "inherits" all of the conventions for black cards and all of the conventions for light pink cards.
- Some specific clarifications and exceptions are listed below.

### Normal Saves

- Dark omni or gray pink 2's on chop should be saved with a number 2 clue, as per normal.
- Dark omni or gray pink 5's on chop should be saved with a number 5 clue, as per normal.

### Pseudo 5 Saves

- Dark omni or gray pink 3's and 4's on chop should be saved with number 5 clue. *Pink Promise* for 3's and 4's does not apply in this variant.
  - This is because we don't want to 

### Pseudo Rank Saves

- In situations where there are critical cards behind dark omni or gray pink cards, you are also allowed to *Fake Save* with any number (either 2, 3, or 4). (Again, *Pink Promise* does not apply to this variant.)
