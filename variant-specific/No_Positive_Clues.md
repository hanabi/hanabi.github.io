# Specific Conventions for Variants with No Positive Clues

These conventions apply to the following variants:

* Extremely Ambiguous (with color clues only)
* Color Blind (with color clues only)
* Number Blind (with number clues only)
* Totally Blind
* Cow & Pig
* Duck

<br />

### Special Move Summary

* If a clue is focusing a critical card on chop, then it is probably a *Save Clue*, as mentioned in the "Basic Conventions" section above.
* If a clue is focusing a card that is not on chop, then it is a *Play Clue*, and the following table applies:

| Type of Clue                           | Interpretation
| -------------------------------------- | --------------
| Any clue focusing a one-away card      | A *Finesse*, a *Transparent Bluff*, or a *Transparent Double Bluff*
| Any clue focusing a two-or-more-away 5 | An *Ejection* (similar to 5CE)
| Any clue focusing a two-or-more-away 3 | A *Discharge* (because 3 means slot 3)
| Any clue focusing a two-or-more-away 4 | A *Charm* (e.g. the 4th *Finesse Position*)

* For more specific information, see each section below.

### The Transparent Bluff

* Normally, you cannot perform a *Bluff* in variants without any positive information. This is because there is no way for the clue to not match the card that is blind-playing.
* However, the one exception to this is if a 5 blind-plays. Then, the clue receiver can know that it is a *Bluff* (because there is no card that matches at 5).
* In this situation, the clue receiver would mark their touched card as a one-away-from-playable card.

### The Transparent Double Bluff

* Normally, you cannot perform a *Bluff* in variants without any positive information. This is because there is no way for the clue to not match the card that is blind-playing.
* However, it is possible to perform a *Double Bluff* by cluing any one-away-from-playable card and getting two non-matching cards to play.
* For example, in a 4-player game of the Duck variant:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 2 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob tries to blind-play red 1 from his *Finesse Position*, but he instead blind-plays the blue 1.
  * Cathy sees that Donald will go on to misplay the red 2 as the blue 2. Thus, this must be a *Double Bluff*, so Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card. It is a green 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Donald knows that he cannot have the blue 2, or else Cathy would not have done anything special. Donald's card can be any one-away-from-playable card in the game.
* *Double Half-Bluffs* are explicitly outlawed. In other words, the first blind-play from a *Double Bluff* must be completely unrelated to the card that was clued. (This is so that the clue-reciever will have more specific information.)

### 5 Ejection

* *5 Color Ejection* is turned on in variants without any positive information, just like it is in any other variant.
* Additionally, players can also perform *5 Number Ejection* and it will generally work in the exact same way.
* Thus, players should keep in mind that clues that cause *Ejection* might have been either a color clue or a number clue.

### 3 Discharge

* *Unknown Trash Discharge* is turned off in variants without any positive information.
* Instead, *3 Discharge* is turned on. In other words, a *Play Clue* focusing a two-or-more-away-from-playable 3 is a signal for the next player to play their *Third Finesse Position*.
* Similar to *5 Ejection*, *3 Discharge* can be initiated with either a color clue or a number clue.

### 4 Charm

* *Charm* is defined as a move that makes a player play their *Fourth Finesse Position*.
* A *Play Clue* focusing a two-or-more-away-from-playable 4 is a signal for the next player to play their *Fourth Finesse Position*.
* Similar to *5 Ejection*, *4 Charm* can be initiated with either a color clue or a number clue.
