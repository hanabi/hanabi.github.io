# Pinging the H-Group

- The H-Group hangs out in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp).
- The group is fairly active so there are usually people playing pick-up games at most hours of the day and night.
- You can observe this by looking to see if there are any people in the "H-Group" voice channels on the left side of the screen. People in a voice chat together indicates that you can hop into the voice chat and join the next game that starts.
- If **no-one is already playing a pick-up game**, then you can try to get people together to get a game going by pinging the "@H-Group - Ping Crew" role by typing it into the #general-lobby channel.
  - For example, `Hello @H-Group - Ping Crew, it is Saturday morning - let's get a game going!"`.
- The people who are assigned this role should then get a notification.
- If you would like to be added to this role, please send Zamiel a direct message on Discord.

## Rules

- Don't ping if there are already one or more pick-up games going on.
- Don't ping more than once every two to three hours.
