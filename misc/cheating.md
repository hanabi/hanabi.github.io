# Cheating in the H-Group

In a game of Hanabi, it is possible to cheat in several ways.

Mild forms of cheating are when players accidentally make "table-talk" comments in voice/text chat during an ongoing game that reveal subtle details about the game. Players in the H-Group are strongly discouraged from doing this. If this does happen, players should explicitly ignore that information when deciding what to do.

More severe forms of cheating are when players log in to an alternate account on their phone in order to spectate an ongoing game that they are playing for the purposes of seeing what their hand is. Players who do this kind of thing are not welcome in the H-Group, as it spoils the integrity of the game and goes against our values.

Most of the time, detecting whether or not someone is cheating is straightforward. In our reviews, we often ask each other why we made the decisions that we did. If a player cannot give a reasonable explanation for why they did a certain move, it betrays that they were operating under more information than they should have had. Thus, when suspicious moves happen, H-Group members should challenge each other in the post-game review to justify these moves.

We don't want to play with or tolerate cheaters. If a member of the H-Group is accused of cheating, purple players will discuss the evidence, and reach a consensus in roughly the same way as a [convention change](convention-changes.md). If a consensus is reached, the player in question will have their purple and/or green roles removed.
