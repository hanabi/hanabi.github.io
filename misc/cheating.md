# Cheating in the Hyphen-ated Group

In a game of Hanabi, it is possible to cheat in several ways.

Mild forms of cheating are when players accidently make "table-talk" comments in voice/text chat during an ongoing game that reveal subtle details about the game. Players in the Hyphen-ated group are strongly discouraged from doing this. If this does happpen, players should explicitly ignore that information when deciding what to do.

More severe forms of cheating are when players log in to an alternate account on their phone in order to spectate an ongoing game that they are playing for the purposes of seeing what their hand is. Players who do this kind of thing are not welcome in the Hyphen-ated group, as it spoils the integrity of what the game and goes against our values.

Thankfully, detecting whether or not someone was cheating is somewhat straightforward. In our reviews, we often ask each other why we made the decisions that we did. If a player cannot give a reasonable explanation for why they did a certain move, then it is obvious that they were operating under more information than they should have had. Thus, when suspicious moves happen, Hyphen-ated group members should challenge each other in the post-game review to justify these moves.

If a member of the Hyphen-ated group is accused of cheating, purple players will discuss the evidence, and reach a consensus in roughly the same way as a [convention change](convention-changes.md). If a consensus is reached, the player in question will have their purple and/or green roles removed.
