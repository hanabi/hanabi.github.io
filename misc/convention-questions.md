## Convention Questions

Ask questions about the H-Group conventions in the in the `#convention-questions` channel. But please follow these rules:

### 1) State the Convention Level

- You **must** include a convention level with your question (even if you think it is obvious).
- Use the level that the players of the game were playing with or the level relating to the convention that you are asking about.

### 2) Use Replay Links or Use Alice and Bob Stories

- If your answer is about something really simple, then ask away. But it is almost always better to provide an example.
- If the question is about **a real game**, then you must include a link to the game by using the `/replay [game id] [turn number]` command.
- Do **not** post a screenshot of the game state.
- If the question is about **a hypothetical**, then you must type out an Alice and Bob story in the style of the convention website.
- (Hypotheticals are generally preferred to replays, since they narrow down the scope of what is happening.)

### 3) Use H-Group Notation

Use notation that the H-Group will be familiar with:

<!-- lint disable no-undefined-references -->

- Use "red 3" instead of "3 red".
- Use "r3" instead of "3r".
- Use "r[3]" to indicate that a card is a red 3 but has a number 3 clue on it.
- If using a replay, then use the names of the players in the replay.
- If using a hypothetical, always use the characters of Alice, Bob, Cathy, Donald, and Emily. (Alice should always be the player who performs the first action.) Do not abbreviate the names as "A", "B", and so forth.

<!-- lint enable no-undefined-references -->

### 4) Attempt to Answer Your Own Question (and Provide a Detailed Explanation)

- You **must** attempt to answer your own question, based on your current understanding of the conventions.
- Provide a detailed explanation as to **why** you think it is the best answer, linking to the relevant sections of the website if necessary.
- For example, the following question will be deleted:
  - /replay 12345 12<br />Level 11 game. Is this a 5 Stall or a 5 Pull?
- For example, the following question is good:
  - /replay 12345 12<br />Level 11 game. Here, it is Alice's turn. It is also the Early Game and no 5 Stalls have been given yet. Thus, based on my understanding of the conventions, when Alice clues number 5 to Bob, it would just be a 5 Stall, because there is no other possible clues that Alice can give. Is this correct?

### 5) Put Everything in One Message

- Type out your entire question into a single message.

### Reasoning

- The reason for needing the level is that it helps us narrow the scope of the question, it serves as a flag to let others know what kind of question it is, and it prevents lower level players from attempting to answer.
- The reason for needing replays is that different people play in different modes (color-blind, art styles, card orientation, etc.).
- The reason for needing Alice and Bob stories and for rule 2 is that it helps us to parse your question more easily.
- The reason for answering your own question is that it allows us to hone in on the specific gaps in your knowledge. It is unfair to ask a low-effort question and then expect others to give a comprehensive response to it.
- The reason for putting everything in one message is that it prevents spamming other people with notifications.
