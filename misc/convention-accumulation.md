# Convention Accumulation

As you probably know, in the H-Group, we play with a lot of conventions - things that we agree to before the game starts. Unlike other groups, we write all of these down in [a formal document](../Reference.md). And this document is _long_.

## The History

A common reaction to seeing a hundred-page-long conventions document for the first time is often surprise: "Wow, these guys are crazy at Hanabi!" But the surprise can quickly turn to disgust: "This list is insane - how can they remember all of these conventions? I would never want to play like this. Even if I did, learning all of these conventions would take years."

And indeed, looking at it from the outside-in, I can agree and sympathize with this reaction. But I think it is important to understand the story of how we got here in the first place.

Our group started playing Hanabi like all other groups - with no conventions whatsoever. Eventually, after getting a little comfortable with the game, we figured out basic things like "_Play Clues_ should probably mean to play the left-most card". Eventually, we graduated to playing _Board Game Arena_-style: a few simple conventions with some _Finesses_ and _Bluffs_ thrown in.

Lots of people who play Hanabi are also general board game enthusiasts, enjoying a wide variety of board games (like [_Codenames_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames) and [_Food Chain Magnate_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/175914/food-chain-magnate)) and card games (like [_Dominion_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion)). So it is common for groups to play Hanabi for a month or so - getting comfortable with the game, developing some conventions, getting pretty good at the game, and then moving on to new challenges. But in our group, we loved Hanabi, and we just kept playing it. Not every day, and not always with the exact same players, but certainly a few games a week at minimum.

As the months went by, we played more and more games. Sometimes, we would stumble upon a unique situation that was difficult to solve with just the "vanilla" set of base conventions. This led to the creation of a new convention - some new kind of _Chop Move_, or some new kind of _Finesse_. And since it was only a couple moves added or changed every month or so, it was relatively easy for everyone to keep up. Even if you didn't play regularly, you could read the #announcements channel in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp) and quickly get up-to-date on the latest changes over the last month or two. And new players could get up-to-speed relatively quickly.

But as the years went by, you can imagine what happened. The process of adding a new move here and there over the course of 3 years can result in _a lot_ of moves. The punchline of this story is that our huge convention list is not an artificial list of things invented all at once. Rather, it is a list of things that naturally flowed from playing 5000+ games of Hanabi in a process of slow iteration, week by week, month by month.

## Learning the Conventions from Scratch

So even if you can understand and empathize with the history of the long convention document, there is still a problem with getting new players up-to-speed. We certainly want new players to join our group - if we stopped getting new players entirely, the group would eventually die out. But with each convention we add, it gets just a little bit harder to come in starting from scratch. There's no getting around it - playing Hanabi with our group is going to be more complicated and more difficult than playing Hanabi with others, because we have been already playing for many years.

But there are some important counterpoints:

### 1) Advanced conventions are "turned off" when playing with beginners\*\*

Beginners don't have to worry about learning everything all at once, because we will "turn off" all of the advanced stuff so that the beginner can focus on the fundamentals.

### 2) Players do not need to know most of the information in the reference document

New players are **not supposed** to read the reference document. We only expect them to read the (relatively-short) beginner's guide. Let's go into why this is.

**Most** of the moves in the reference document follow from basic logic. New players can usually figure out what a move is in the middle of the game without ever having seen it before! (But it is still worth putting the move in the reference document, just to be thorough.)

Some other things in the reference document only apply **very rarely**, like once in every hundred games or so. So, it would be fairly pointless to burden non-expert players with knowledge that would almost never be utilized. (But it is still worth putting the rare situation in the reference document, just to be thorough.)

Yet other things in the reference document only apply to specific variants. There are over a thousand different variants on Hanab Live, and unless you are an expert player, it is going to be pretty pointless to try and learn the intricacies of each one, especially considering that people typically play "No Variant" and "Rainbow" games for their first 100-200 games.

### 3) We want to strike a compromise between new and expert players

From time to time, we "pare down" the convention-framework to try and reduce to total amount (and complexity) of the conventions. We never want to get to a point where it becomes too complicated to learn the framework from scratch.

But we also want to keep the expert players from getting bored. As a group, we want to continue to innovate and refine our convention-framework to be the best it can be, and sometimes that can mean changing some existing convention or adding a new move.

### 4) We want to have high-level and fulfilling games

What is the flip-side of having more conventions and more complexity? First off, it raises the skill ceiling. Hanabi throws plenty of tricky situations at you, and you only have a limited number of tools to solve them. By adding some conventions, it can be like adding additional tools to the tool-belt. For expert players, by empowering them with more tools, it increases the total ways in which they can solve problems, making the game take on a new layer of beauty. But even for newer players, it can be very fun to learn how to make your teammates blind-play cards from their hands in new and exciting ways.

We know that for people who really like Hanabi, it will be worth the extra effort to play with a little more complexity.
