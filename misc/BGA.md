# Welcoming Board Game Arena Players

<br />

## Introduction

This page is written for people who have a bunch of games on [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/) and may be interested in playing some games with the *H-Group* on [Hanab Live](https://www.hanab.live). Since our group uses some advanced conventions, this page should be a quick guide to get BGA players up to speed.

(A quick note: On Hanab Live, you can play with anyone you want and you can play with any conventions you want - it is a free website. However, a good chunk of the players who play on the website are all part of the *H-Group*, so if you are playing non-H-Group games on the website, it might be hard to get a pick-up game going with random strangers.)

Why bother taking the time to branch out from Board Game Arena to play Hanabi elsewhere? In order to properly answer that question, here's a short introduction on the differences between BGA and Hanab Live. It should explain why, at the very least, you might want to dabble on both platforms. If you are already convinced, you can skip down to the section on [convention changes](#convention-changes-beginner).

<br />

### Board Game Arena

Board Game Arena is a website that allows people to play all different types of board games. It introduced Hanabi on the platform in June 2014, and it is currently the most popular place to play Hanabi online. For the most part, it has players ready to play at most times of the day, making it easy to hop into a quick game. Even though you will often be playing with complete strangers, most people on the site play with the same basic conventions, so little coordination is needed. And everyone is generally quite friendly!

Board Game Arena also has an ELO system, which insulates the expert players from the newbies. As you move up the ranks, you will start to get games with the same players, which also allows you to get to know everyone in the community a bit more intimately.

#### BGA's Interface

BGA upgraded their interface in 2020 to have a newer look. A lot of BGA players preferred the older interface to the new one. However, regardless of whether you are talking about the older interface, or the newer interface, they really leave a lot to be desired:

- There is an in-game replay feature, but using it is frustrating. Once you initiate a replay, you are stuck watching the movie until it reaches the present, with no ability to pause, and no ability to move back and forth at will.
- There is no ability to see negative clues. You can keep track of them via memory, but this is quite cumbersome to do perfectly. Using negative clues is essential to playing at a high-level.
- There is no ability to mark notes on a card. Making notes may sound silly to players who have been trained to remember everything, but having the ability to quickly and easily record contextual information really takes the game to another level. On BGA, if you want to make notes, you have to resort to jotting them down on a piece of paper or a separate program.
- And a bunch of minor things:
  - No ability to see the cards touched by the last clue.
  - No distinction for playing cards blind (or discarding clued cards).
  - Delay after making a move, combined with slow animations.
  - Non-customizable time controls.
  - Only the most basic variants.
  - And no "shared replays" for reviewing!

#### Paywall

In December of 2020, Board Game Arena introduced a soft-paywall: players can no longer start a Hanabi table unless you pay them money for a premium subscription. Non-paying players can still join tables that other people create, though.

#### The Lack of Reviewing

Besides the problems with the user interface, there is another big disadvantage with BGA: no reviewing.

Since there are so many players on the site, a general culture has emerged where once a game is over, players will typically just jump into the next game with the next player. Of course, this doesn't always occur, and there may be some lively post-game discussions from time to time. But this is the exception rather than the norm. In a way, it makes sense: why bother giving other players tips or have a discussion after the end of the game when you may not ever play with that player again? It is just more practical to move on.

Of course, this problem is compounded by the terrible replay system. Even if players wanted to go over the replay of a game to analyze certain key moments, the replay system is not very conducive to this task - it requires some coordination to get every player to load up the replay on a specific turn, and even then, not all of the cards are revealed.

<br />

### Hanab Live

Hanab Live was created by me (Zamiel) in June 2017 as a replacement for Keldon's excellent online implementation (which is now offline). Whereas BGA is closed-source and impossible to edit by the average user, Hanab Live is open-source: we can add new variants, add new features, fix bugs, and so forth.

#### Hanab Live's Interface

<img src="../static/img/bga/bga-mode.png" alt="The Hanab Live Interface" height="450px" />

All of the interface issues with BGA are fixed in the Hanab Live interface: it is snappier, it conveys all the information you need to know, and allows you to move forward and backward through time with ease. (This new default UI was created in September 2018.) Admittedly, not everything is exactly the same as it is on BGA. As you can see, the discard pile is on the bottom-right-hand corner instead of the bottom-left-hand corner. With that said, the interface should be fairly easy to use.

#### Reviewing

Many different people play on the website, but I think that the majority are part of the *H-Group*. In terms of playstyle, we play in a manner similar to how BGA players play, but with a lot more "special moves" thrown in.

More importantly, when *H-Group* members play together, we typically review every single game, turn by turn. Why do this? It accelerates the process of synchronizing everyone's strategies and playstyle to ensure that we are all on the same page. And it accelerates the process of making everyone really good at Hanabi, because people get the chance to learn from mistakes that they never would have known that they made. It's just a lot of fun - reviewing the game and looking for the best moves can be more fun than actually playing the game.

For the purposes of reviewing, we talk to each other in a voice chat. Using a voice chat is worlds better than typing text snippets at each other, as you may imagine. To facilitate this, we use a program called [Discord](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp), which is a voice and chat application similar to Skype. (Discord is in widespread use among gamers nowadays and doesn't have the security vulnerabilities that Skype does.)

If you aren't interested in reviewing your Hanabi games, then that's a full stop - this document isn't really aimed at you. If you are interested in reviewing but don't have a microphone, then you could try using the Discord app on a cell phone. And if you don't have a cell phone, you could always grab a cheap microphone from a local thrift store or electronics store.

#### Time Controls

One major addition to Hanab Live is that you can set games to have whatever time controls you want. This means that you can have untimed games, reasonably timed games similar to BGA, or even "blitz" games where you only have 5-10 seconds to move. Blitz games can be an extremely fun challenge for experienced Hanabi players, and provides an entirely new way to enjoy the game. In our group, we play a mix of both fast games and normal games.

Beyond just fast games, our group also engages in speedruns, where you try to complete the game as fast as possible. [Every world record](https://www.speedrun.com/hanabi) is held by members of our group. Much like blitz games, speedruns can be an extremely fun challenge for expert players.

A side point here is that speedruns are viable on Hanab Live because it is nice and snappy. It isn't really possible to do speedruns on BGA with all of the lag, long animations, and server problems.

#### Getting Games Going

Getting a game going on Hanab Live is pretty different from how you would get a game going on BGA, since there is not a large pool of players to draw from. This means that you can't just click the "Create Table" button and have random people join your game, like you would on BGA.

If the H-Group is playing, there will typically be people in the voice channels in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp). If there are people in the voice channels, then just join the respective voice channel, wait for their game to end, and then ask to join the next game.

#### Small Number of Players

If you are trying to get a game going at a weird time, there might not be any H-Group people around. So, that can be an annoying part of playing here.

What is the flip-side of not having very many members? Better cohesion, aided by discussion. When you are able to get a crew together, your games will potentially be more fulfilling and in-depth than on Board Game Arena.

#### Extra Conventions and Extra Complexity

Another potentially bad aspect of playing with our group is the complexity involved. We are welcoming of new players, but I won't deny that we play at a higher level than the average BGA player. It is going to be a longer journey to become an expert in our group than it would be to be an expert at BGA. And if you are already comfortable with the BGA conventions, it might just be too frustrating to experiment with different ways of doing things.

What is the flip-side of having more conventions and more complexity? First off, it raises the skill ceiling. Hanabi throws plenty of tricky situations at you, and you only have a limited number of tools to solve them. By adding some conventions, it can be like adding additional tools to the tool-belt. For expert players, by empowering them with more tools, it increases the total ways in which they can solve problems, making the game take on a new layer of beauty. But even for intermediate players, it can be very fun to gain the powers to make your teammates blind-play cards from their hands in new and exciting ways.

We know that for people who really like Hanabi, it will be worth the extra effort to play with a little more complexity.

#### Conclusion

One final thing to note is that, as a BGA player, you don't need to "convert" away from BGA, like it is some kind of religion. Rather, feel free to experiment and play on either platform, as it is absolutely possible to switch back and forth between convention frameworks. You can think of this as similar to a bilingual person switching from Spanish to French - you don't necessarily have to choose between the two.

## Convention Changes (Beginner)

If you're reading this far, you'll want to know some of the basic differences between the *BGA Convention Framework* and the *H-Group Convention Framework*. Fear not - it isn't so bad once you play a few games.

<br />

### What's the Same?

- Below, you'll find a whole bunch of stuff about how our group does things differently from the way you are familiar with.
- I think it is important to communicate right from the start that **most stuff will be the exact same as you are used to on BGA**.
- Stuff like giving *Finesses*, giving *Bluffs*, paying attention to see that no-one on the team discards anything important, using good teamwork - all of this will carry over more or less exactly.

### What's Different?

- We will get into some specifics shortly. But in general, BGA conventions are more focused on ***Tempo*** (getting cards played "right now") and **aggressive discarding**, while H-Group conventions are focused more on **orchestrating safe discards** and **absolute trust**.
- Another general difference is when mistakes happen. On BGA, there is more wiggle room when someone makes a small mistake. In our group, even a small mistake can cause cascading failures, because everyone is strongly attuned to what everyone else is doing.

### A Note on the Conventions Themselves

- On BGA, the "rules" or conventions by which people play are largely unwritten, and can change from game to game. But you'll almost certainly have a good grasp of them after having played a bunch of games, and many are talked about on the [2b or not 2b group forums](https://en.boardgamearena.com/#!group?id=1598286).
- In our group, the rules are [completely documented](https://hanabi.github.io). Yeah, don't bother reading every single convention now, but note that you can use it in case you ever need to look up something specific.
- Why do this? Having a strongly defined set of rules cuts out most silly post-game arguments on how an ambiguous-looking clue should be interpreted. Instead, it encourages discussion on finding the most efficient moves and strategies within a shared framework, which is much more productive.

### 2 Saves - Added Always

- The *2 Saves Convention* is when someone clues number 2 and it touches a 2 on chop. Even if it touches some other 2, it doesn't necessarily mean anything is currently playable - the point of the clue was to save one or more 2's.
- On BGA, *2 Saves* are typically "turned on" in 2-player games, and sometimes turned on in 3-player games, but almost always turned off in 4-player games and 5-player games.
- In our group, *2 Saves* are **always** turned on, regardless of the number of players.
- Why do this? Having this convention eliminates 100% of "bottom-deck" losses to 2's.

### Clue Focus on Retouched Cards - Changed

- When multiple cards are "touched" by a clue, it typically only means to play one card. We call that card the *focus* of the clue.
- On BGA, the focus can either be on the "new" card, or a card that is "filled in". Typically, if a filled in card looks like it is playable, then that is the focus. For example, in a Rainbow game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a card in her hand clued with number 2.
  - Bob clues Alice red, filling in the 2 with red and also touching a new card on her newest slot.
  - Alice plays the "filled-in" card as the focus of the clue, and holds on to the other red card for later.
- Furthermore, on BGA, clues given similar to the one in the example above can **also** mean to play both cards, depending on the situation. (i.e. Alice plays red 2 and then plays red 3.)
- In our group, **the focus of the clue is always on card that did not have any clues on it already**. (We refer to this as the **new card introduced**.) In the previous example, Alice should play her newest card as either red 2 or rainbow 1. She is promised nothing about her other red card, meaning that it can be either red 2 or rainbow 2.
- Why do this? Having this convention makes it extremely clear exactly what card is being talked about in almost all situations - **no guesswork involved**.

### Chop-Focus - Added

- It is common for a *Play Clue* to introduce several cards in the hand. So, which one is playable?
- On BGA, the system is dead simple: (almost) always play the left-most card.
- In our group, it is a two step process:
  - If one of the new cards introduced was on the chop, then it is a *Chop-Focus Play Clue*.
  - Otherwise, it is a *Left-Most Play Clue*.
- Why do this? For multiple reasons:
  - Without this convention, it takes more than one clue to give a *Play Clue* to a chop card.
  - This convention compliments *Finesses*. (Our group has a wide variety of *Finesses* and *Bluffs*, so it is easy to "get" fresh cards, but more difficult to "get" cards on chop.)
  - Consider the situation where all critical 4s are currently playable and a player receives a number 4 clue on newest + chop. On BGA, the focus of the clue is ambiguous. In our group, you can always play chop.
- Don't worry - having *Chop-Focus* turned on does not limit your options as much as you would think. With good players, you can often give a BGA-style clue that is NOT meant to be *Chop-Focus*, and the other players will be able to figure it out from the negative information on the card or the context of the game. (We call this *Focus Inversion*, but let's not go into too much detail on that right now.)

### Color Saves - Changed

- One problem in Hanabi is when a clue lights up your chop card for the first time. How do you know whether it is a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*?
- On BGA, there is a simple system: number clues mean *Save Clues* and color clues mean *Play Clues*. (Of course, there are exceptions, but this applies most of the time.)
- In our group, both number clues **and** color clues can be used to save cards.
- **Any** clue that touches the chop has to be treated as a *Save Clue* first and foremost. If you can rule out a *Save Clue* interpretation, then you know that it is a *Chop-Focus Play Clue*.
- Why do this? It allows us to choose the exact clue type that would avoid touching duplicated cards.

### Early Save Play Clues - Deleted

- On BGA, a timing system is used such that if a card is saved "early" before it really needs to be saved, then the clue must not be a *Save Clue* at all, and instead transforms into a *Play Clue*. For now, let's call this a *Early Save Play Clue*. (Other people also call it a *Loaded Play Clue*.)
- In our group, there is no such timing system. **All** clues that look like *Save Clues* are *Save Clues*, even if they are early.
- Why do this? It allows for better *Discard Modulation*.

### The Early Game - Added

- On BGA, you don't want to discard on the first few turns. But after that, you can pretty much discard whenever you want.
- In our group, we have a thing called the *Early Game*. The *Early Game* is defined as the period of time before someone discards for the first time. When they do, they initiate the *Mid-Game*.
- In the *Early Game*, everyone agrees that they **must** "extinguish" all of the available *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* before discarding.
- Why do this? It prevents a certain percentage of "bottom-deck" losses by having cards on chop stick around for a little longer.

<br />

## Convention Changes (Intermediate)

Ok, so you've made it this far. The changes so far probably sound pretty strange, but at least most of the core stuff is still the same. Before reading further, you'll probably want to play a few games with us to get a feel for how the basics work. Beyond the basics, there are some other changes, as well as some new moves.

<br />

### Double Discard Avoidance (DDA) - Changed

- *Double Discarding* is when two players discard the same thing in a row (say, a red 4) and it causes a perfect score to be lost.
- On BGA, in 2-player games, top players will often perform *Hard Double Discard Avoidance*.
- In this context, "hard avoidance" means that a player will avoid *Double Discarding* at all costs. If they are in danger of *Double Discarding*, then they will give any clue at all to avoid it, even if it is a complete waste of a clue.
- On BGA, in 3+ player games, players generally do not perform *Hard Double Discard Avoidance*. Instead, they use two other strategies to prevent *Double Discards* from occurring:
  - First, players are generally allowed to save a copy of a non-critical card if both copies of that card are on the chop of adjacent players.
  - Second, players can indirectly solve the problem by planning a line where it sets up one of the DD players to give an obvious clue.
- In our group, there is no need to do either of these strategies, because *Hard Double Discard Avoidance* is **always** turned on, regardless of the number of players.
- Why do this? It narrows the possibilities of what *Save Clues* can be, which is quite useful. Furthermore, it eliminates the silliness involved in dancing around a *Double Discard* situation - players simply do not have to worry about it and can focus on always giving the highest efficiency clue for the situation.
- Finally, if a player notices that someone *Double Discards* when they weren't supposed to, they can mark their hand for the exact card, which is quite powerful.

### Chop Moves - Added

- On BGA, there are certain situations where you save a card in your hand permanently, even though it is not clued.
- In our group, we give this move a name - the *Chop Move*. We think of the *Chop Move* like an invisible clue that is applied to the chop card.
- *Chop Moved* cards are permanent - you should never discard them, similar to how you would never normally discard a card that already has a clue on it.
- There are several ways to initiate a *Chop Move*, some of which are detailed below.

### Scream Discard Chop Moves - Changed

- On BGA, if you discard with a known playable card, it is usually a "danger" signal - the next person has something important on chop. So, the next person will give a stall clue, and then the important card in question will be explicitly saved by someone else on the next go-around of the table.
- In our group, we give this move a name - the *Scream Discard*. This is because when you do it, it is like you are screaming at the next player.
- Furthermore, in our group, we don't bother wasting a clue to explicitly save the card. The player is expected to *Chop Move* the card forever.
- Why do this? It is more efficient to not have to waste clues on critical cards that are not currently playable.

### The 5's Chop Move - Added

- On BGA, if you clue number 5 to a 5 that is one-away-from-chop, high-level players will usually interpret it as a *Play Clue* on the 5 or a stall clue, depending on the situation.
- In our group, we assign a special meaning to number 5 clues that introduce a new 5 that is **exactly** one-away from chop. You guessed it - it's a *Chop Move*.
- Why do this? It allows players to use this special power to save two cards with one clue. For example, it can be used to save a critical card that is followed by a 5. Or, you can even use it to permanently save a non-critical but-still-useful card.

### Trash Chop Moves - Changed

- On BGA, if you clue some cards which are known-trash, this gives the player some safe discards. This is usually done if you don't want that player to discard their chop card. However, after they have discarded these cards, there are different opinions on what the player should discard next.
- In our group, a known-trash clue causes **all** cards behind the oldest clued card to be *Chop Moved*.

### The Order Chop Move - Added

- In the beginning of the game, it is common for two or more 1's to get clued in the same person's hand.
- On BGA, people typically play their 1's from oldest to newest. However, if they don't, people just assume that a mistake is being made, and don't pay too much attention beyond that.
- In our group, we pay attention. If you don't play your 1's from oldest to newest, it *Chop Moves* the next person.
- Why do this? You get to save 5's (and other valuable stuff) "for free" without having to waste a clue. It's a bit arbitrary, but very strong.

### Layered Finesses - Added

- On BGA, if you are playing into a *Finesse* but play an unrelated card, then you interpret the *Finesse* as a *Bluff* instead, and stop playing.
- In our group, you can **only** *Bluff* the very next player.
- This means that if someone plays into a *Finesse*, and they were not the very next player after the cluer, then they will **continue** to play cards in their hand from left to right until they find the promised card.
- This is called a *Layered Finesse* because the intended *Finesse* blind-play target is "layered" behind other playable cards. (Isdariel refers to this as a *Deep Finesse*.)
- For example, in a 4-player game with Alice, Bob, Cathy, and Donald:
  - Alice clues red to Donald as a *Play Clue* on a red 2.
  - This promises that someone has the red 1.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy knows that she has the red 1, because she doesn't see anyone else have the red 1.
  - Cathy blind-plays a blue 1 (from slot 1).
  - Cathy knows that Alice is only allowed to bluff Bob. Thus, Cathy cannot be *Bluffed*; Cathy must actually have the red 1 as a *Layered Finesse*.
  - On her next turn, Cathy tries to blind-play the red 1 (from slot 2), but it is really the blue 2.
  - On her next turn, Cathy tries to blind-play the red 1 (from slot 3), but it is really the blue 3.
  - On her next turn, Cathy blind-plays red 1 (from slot 4).
  - Donald plays red 2.
- By extension, it is also possible to perform a *Double Finesse* where both promised cards are *Layered* behind other playable cards. Essentially, this means that when playing with good players, you always have to keep in mind that a *Finesse* could be *Layered*.
- Why do this? It's pretty awesome and one of the most fun parts of playing Hanabi with our group.

<br />

## Convention Changes (Advanced)

These are conventions that we don't typically turn on for new players, but we do use regularly in high-level games.

<br />

### The Priority Finesse - Added

- Often times, a player will have two or more playable cards in their hand and have a choice as to which one to play.
- On BGA, it is typical for people to play the cards that lead into teammate's hands. However, you are ultimately allowed to play your cards in whatever order you want, and no-one really pays too much attention.
- In our group, we pay attention.
- For example:
  - Alice has a known red 1 and a known blue 1 to play.
  - Bob has a known red 2 to play and is waiting for Alice to play the red 1.
  - Alice is expected to play the red 1. (The red 1 is said to have *Priority*.) Instead, Alice plays the blue 1.
  - Thus, Alice is **promising** that someone one the team has the blue 2 on their *Finesse Position*. Whoever has it should blind-play it, similar to if a *Finesse* was performed.
- You can also do *Priority Bluffs*. It works surprisingly well in a variety of situations.
- Why do this? It gets cards "for free" without having to use any clues and has few downsides.

### 3 Bluffs - Added

- On BGA, cards that are touched to initiate a *Bluff* are typically known to be one-away from being playable. (There is also a more complex interpretation called a *Promise Bluff* that I won't go into.)
- In our group, we arbitrarily agree that any card used to initiate a *Bluff* can be either a one-away card OR a 3.
  - If a one-away card is used to initiate a *Bluff*, then we call that a normal *Bluff*.
  - If a two-away 3 is used to initiate a *Bluff*, then we call that a *3 Bluff*.
- Players are allowed to initiate *3 Bluffs* with either color or number.
- This is one of the more arbitrary and tricky conventions that we have, so it will take a few games to get used to.
- Why do this? It allows us to get 2-for-1 clues in situations where you would otherwise have to do a 1-for-1. Furthermore, it allows us to mitigate a good percentage of "bottom-deck" losses to 3's. (And if you're really interested, you can read [the story of how 3 Bluffs were invented](3-bluffs.md)).

<br />

## A Concluding Note

Reading the stuff on this page will give you the major tools that you will need to play with our group. You can and should stop reading now and play some games with us! There's certainly some other minor things to learn, but you will quickly learn the rest from direct experience and post-game reviews.

Know that you certainly **do not** have to read and memorize [all of our conventions](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/reference/) before playing with us! This is a common misconception that new players have. The website is meant to be used as a reference, and not meant to be read from start to finish.
