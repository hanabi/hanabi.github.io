# Logic vs conventions

Different groups who play Hanabi have different ideas about how the game should be played.

- Some groups believe that any form of communication before or after the game should be forbidden, putting the emphasis of the game on trying to guess your teammate's intentions, much like in party games such as Codenames or The Crew. Such groups, for example, often do not "allow" _Finesses_.
- Most groups are a bit more relaxed, allowing people to ask questions like "what do you remember about your cards?" during the game to reduce the load on memory, or to discuss strategy between games and allow conventions that come up organically within the group for future games. For example, in the [Group Meta Progression](group-meta-progression.md) document, it's described how a lot of groups independently invent the same strategies such as _Bluffs_ or _Finesses_ over time.
- And of course, on the other extreme, the H-group takes things all the way the other direction by having an entire written website mapping out all the strategies were developed over the years. The history of how these conventions came to be is described in the [Convention Accumulation document](convention-accumulation.md).

It's not the purpose of this document to claim that one way of playing is "better" than the other. Hanabi is a game, and players should play however they find the most fun. Some groups want to play a social deduction party game, and that's okay. Other groups want to play a deep strategy game, and that's okay too.

Nonetheless, for players who haven't played with a high level of complexity before, there are some common misconceptions about how a formally defined convention framework affects the game.

## There is no sharply defined distinction between "logic only", "logical conventions", or "arbitrary conventions".

Some people argue there is an objective delineation between "logical" moves like _Finesses_ that can be derived from first principles, and arbitrary moves like _Order Chop Move_ that could have any arbitrary meaning. However, one thing that we have realized over the years is that it is actually impossible to make this delineation, because groups disagree vehemently about what exactly is "logical".

Instead, it's more accurate to say **there is a continuum** in terms of how contextual (and how intuitive) different play styles can be. As we described before, some people prefer playing with _less structured_ conventions than the H-Group, and that's okay.

When you play Hanabi, it is impossible for everyone to turn off their brains and stop from noticing things that happen, or modelling patterns of behavior. This will obviously happen as soon as you play a second game with a player - you will be utterly helpless to instinctively interpret their clues based on what they did in the previous game. This is just a basic part of being a human being, and you cannot "turn it off".

For this reason, "playing without conventions" or that "only use logic" are strange statements if unqualified â€” because there are many examples of possible bifurcations in what is "logical" and those choices will settle after plays.

## Having a complex framework does not kill the game.

The other common misconception is that having a formal convention document like the H-group reduces to the game to robotically following a pre-determined flow chart, and therefore sucks the life out of the game. Any expert player from the H-Group could tell you this could not be farther from the truth.

The first reason is that even the H-Group document is less rigid than its long length makes it appear. Even within systems with defined conventions, there is a lot of fun to be had with playing "high sensitivity" Hanabi, with trying to read beyond the mechanical interpretations, and with interpreting clues falling outside normal conventions. Thus, even the conventions documents warns players to [not simply follow a flowchart](https://hanabi.github.io/level-12#context):

> Up until now, you may have the impression that the group has a lot of conventions, and that if you just memorize all of the conventions, you will become a really good Hanabi player. Or, you may have the impression that the conventions are like laws and that you must always follow them. Neither of these things are true... figuring out what a clue means is never truly as easy as following one of the flowcharts listed on the website.

More importantly, the H-group conventions mostly focus on how to _interpret_ clues by agreeing on a common "textbook meaning" for all clues. This still leaves a lot of room for the players to make decisions, because they have to decide _which_ clues to give! This framework thus enables a level of "cooperative puzzle-solving". That is, by working with prior agreement on what clues "should" mean in the "usual" case, the focus shits to planning and creativity as expert players try to choreograph their way out of tight situations, make judgment calls about playing aggressively versus managing risk conservatively, and so on.
