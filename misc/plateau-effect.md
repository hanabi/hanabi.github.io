# The Plateau Effect

Hanabi may be unlike anything you've learned before.

In learning some things, progress is linear. Let's take the example of training for a footrace. In your first week of doing mile-long runs, your times might be around 10 minutes. But after a few weeks, it might drop to 9 minutes. And drop again to 8 minutes after a few more weeks. This is great - as a runner looking to improve, you have a clear, quantitative indication of your progress. And it is motivating to know that you are for-sure improving.

In learning other things, progress is not quite so straightforward. Hanabi is interesting in that almost all players **do not** learn in the way outlined in the previous example. Typically, players will _plateau_ at a certain skill level, making the **exact same mistake** over and over. And then, after a period of no observable increase in skill, they will make a breakthrough - the thing that they consistently messed up over and over is now effortless. Some games are just like this, and it is pretty bizarre if you have never experienced it before.

For example, one of the first things that people usually _plateau_ on is the ability to "see" _Finesses_ - new players will **always** miss _Finesses_ directed at them. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't a big deal, because it can be a good learning experience. But even after an in-depth _Finesse_ explanation is given in the post-game review, the new player will go on to miss another _Finesse_ in the next game. Why aren't they learning from their mistake? Because they have _plateaued_.

In this scenario, it's obviously going to be frustrating for the _Finesse_-missing player. They are going to feel dumb that they keep making the same mistake. They are going to feel like they are not making any progress. And when playing games, they will have to devote much of their mental energy to try and figure out if every single clue given is a _Finesse_ or not.

But after a week or so of this, the new skills will have had time to settle, and something will "click" in their brain. All of a sudden, the player will realize that seeing _Finesses_ is trivial - they are automatically playing into them without thinking about it at all. We could say that the player has had a break-through and is no longer _plateaued_.

Of course, there is much more to Hanabi than just seeing _Finesses_. After their breakthrough, the player will find that they consistently make some new mistake, like failing to see an _Order Chop Move_. And now, all of their mental energy previously devoted to seeing _Finesses_ is now devoted to seeing _Order Chop Moves_. And so the cycle repeats.

Why is it important to talk about the _Plateau Effect_? As a newer player, you might have already realized that Hanabi is like Chess - easy to learn, but deep enough that it might take months (or years) to master. That's what makes it so much fun to play over and over. But in Hanabi, the process of _learning how to play the game itself_ is **non-linear**. Meaning that not only will you make mistakes, but you will make **the same mistakes** over and over. You will get stuck.

And that's what this blog is about. Getting stuck is normal, so you shouldn't feel discouraged. All of the experienced players have made all of the same mistakes you have, and hundreds of other ones, besides. They know that "levelling up" is a long process. And if you continue to play, the reward from breaking through can be quite meaningful.

The above passages are mostly directed at beginners, but the general advice of "don't give up" can similarly be directed at intermediate players. Just like leveling up in an RPG, each successive _plateau_ will take an even longer period of grinding out games to overcome. Intermediate players might come to the conclusion that they will just never be as good as the more experienced players. But this is just because the later _plateaus_ take months of playing to surpass.
