# Changes to *The H-Group Convention Framework*

- The set of conventions that everyone to in the group is defined as the *Convention Framework*.
- The framework evolves over time, as new strategies are thought up, older strategies are no longer used, and existing strategies are changed.

<br />

## Who can submit changes to the *Convention Framework*?

- Anyone can propose a new move or a change to the conventions, regardless of whether they are new to the group or old.
- However, we ask that players have a firm grasp of the general way we play before they start proposing things (e.g. max level).

<br />

## How are *Convention Framework* changes proposed?

- We use the [GitHub issues tracker](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/issues) for this repository in order to organize convention proposals. (All GitHub-related discussion is also mirrored to the `#new-conventions` channel in [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp).)
- Players must submit [a new issue](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/issues/new) for their request or proposed change.
- In a new issue, players will typically type up a short paragraph of the proposed change. Screenshots and/or Alice and Bob stories are encouraged so that other players can easily understand what is being proposed.
- Then, other players can comment on whether they like it or not, or if they see any potential problems.

<br />

## Do I need a GitHub account to submit new proposals or to comment on other people's proposals?

- Yes, you do. Thankfully, GitHub accounts are free and it is relatively painless to create one.
- GitHub allows us to have threaded discussion and makes things much easier to track.

<br />

## Do I need to be an expert player in order to review the latest *Convention Framework* changes or join in the discussion?

- No, you do not. Anyone at an intermediate level or above is encouraged to read the latest issues and participate in the discussion, at least if that kind of thing is interesting to you.

<br />

## How long are *Convention Framework* changes discussed for?

- No decisions are made immediately, as:
  - We want the convention framework to change fairly slowly.
  - Not every player regularly reads the GitHub issues, so we want to allow time for everyone to comment.
- The length of time to wait will depend on how big the change is:
  - If it is a small, non-controversial change, then it might make sense to immediately implement it.
  - Otherwise, we would typically wait a while so that everyone has time to chime in.
  - If there is a good amount of consensus about a move, then this will shorten the amount of time that it is in consideration for.

<br />

## What decides whether or not a change gets implemented?

- All convention changes are made by **group consensus**.
- For the purposes of determining consensus, each player that has an opinion is given a weighed representation based on the following things (in ordered of most important to least important):
  - Perceived skill level
  - Holistic knowledge of the convention framework
  - How active they are at the current time (playing every day, etc.)
  - How long they have been playing with the group
  - How many games they have played with the group
  - How often they participate in the convention discussion
- Determining consensus is **necessarily arbitrary**. In the case of a "tie" or a close call, preference is given to keeping the *Convention Framework* the way that it already is.

<br />

## How is consensus determined when a proposed change is not discussed?

- Many convention proposals are ignored or not heavily discussed. After a period of time, a decision will have to be made one way or the other.
- If it is a large or potentially contentious change, then consensus is gathered manually by sending a direct message to a few of the most skilled members of the group, asking what their opinion is.
- If it is a small change, and no-one has any strong opinions, then Zamiel will usually decide one way or the other.

<br />

## How fast does the *Convention Framework* as a whole change?

- Changes usually happen slowly, over the course of months. This allows players who only play occasionally time to adjust (e.g. players who only play on the weekends, and so forth).

<br />

## Are there any probationary conventions?

- By default, players generally use the conventions that are specified in the main [website](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/reference/).
- Conventions listed in the [GitHub issues tracker](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/issues) are considered probationary. Players can agree to play with one or more probationary conventions before the game begins, if they want to try something out.
- When the issue for a proposed convention is closed, it will be integrated into the main website. At that time, it is no longer considered to be probationary.

<br />

## When are new conventions announced? How do announcements work?

- Convention changes are announced to the group via the `#announcements` channel in the Discord server.
- Every single convention change is announced to the group in this way (unless it is really small or insignificant).
- Changes are generally announced at the same time that the website is updated.
- However, there are at maximum two or three convention changes announced per week. The reason for this is to not overwhelm players of the group - not everybody wants to play Hanabi every day or read a bunch of boring convention-related stuff.
- If there are more than 2-3 changes that occurred that week, then those changes will get put on a [backlog](announcement-backlog.md) and will be announced the following week.
- If the backlog gets long enough, it can potentially be a long while before a convention gets announced to the group. Players who do not regularly read the GitHub issues can always [check the backlog](announcement-backlog.md) if they want to find a quick list of recent changes.

<br />

## How permanent are changes to the *Convention Framework*?

- No change is permanent. If the group consensus changes, then the *Convention Framework* should change.
- With that said, it is confusing for players in the group who do not play very often to have a certain move be "turned on" one day and then "turned off" the next day. Thus, we do **not** want the *Convention Framework* to flop back and forth.
- If consensus is reached on a certain convention configuration, then as a general rule it should not be up for debate again for a period of six months.

<br />

## Why are conventions deleted? Who decides when a convention should be removed from the website?

- After a period of time, rarely-used conventions are removed from the convention framework and deleted from the website. The reasons for this are two fold:
  - Every "move" or section on the website has a cost associated with it. It is only worth the cost if the move is routinely used. The logic for this is outlined in the [convention goals document](convention-goals.md).
  - The website is a living document meant to be a reflection of what players in our group actually do on a day-to-day basis, rather than an encyclopedia of all possible Hanabi moves.
- Whether or not a move is used often enough to warrant being included on the website is also based on consensus.
