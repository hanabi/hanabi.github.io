# Meta-Convention Concepts

<br />

### Head-Space Convention

* A *Head-Space Convention* is a convention that results in a relatively high cognitive load when they are "turned on". Players will have to keep this convention in mind throughout the game and remember that it could apply when common things happen.
* An example of a *Head-Space Convention* would be an *Occupied Play Clue* (from the Hyphen-ated conventions):
  * In a normal game, *Save Clues* are quite common.
  * But if a player who is *Occupied* with a playable card performs a *Save Clue*, it is sometimes not a *Save Clue* at all. Instead, it transforms into an *Occupied Play Clue*.
  * Since any *Save Clue* can be an *Occupied Play Clue* if certain conditions apply, players have to constantly keep this in mind throughout the entire game. Every single time a *Save clue* is done, players will have to perform a cognitive check and ask themselves: "Could this be an *Occupied Play Clue*?
  * Players have to remain vigilant and continue to ask this question for every single *Save Clue*, even though only around 1 in 30 *Save Clues* will be an *Occupied Play Clue*.
* If complexity needs to be reduced from a convention framework, then deleting a *Head-Space Convention* will provide much more value than if a different kind of convention was deleted.

### Specific Prescription Convention

* Most convention frameworks do not prescribe what to do in every single Hanabi situation; the game is too complicated to be completely mapped out. With that said, as a group, it is helpful to agree on what to do in some special situations that could be interpreted in ambiguous ways.
* A *Specific Prescription Convention* is a convention that only applies to a specific unusual situation. Thus, players do not generally have to keep the convention in mind throughout the game.
* Players only have to know about *Specific Prescription Conventions* when the specific situation in question comes up. Typically, if a player is not familiar with the convention and does not know what to do already, they will probably be able to identify that something quite strange has happened, and can then quickly reference a convention document to see if there is a convention that covers the situation.
* An example of a *Specific Prescription Convention* would be a *Order Chop Move* (from the Hyphen-ated conventions):
  * *Order Chop Moves* are performed by playing 1's out of order.
  * They only occur during the first part of the game, so players do not have to keep them in mind throughout the whole game.
  * Furthermore, even in the first part of the game, players do not have to keep the convention in the forefront of their minds. They can simply notice that something strange has happened: "Wow! Alice played her 1's out of order! That was very strange!" And noticing this will trigger the remembering of the convention.
* If complexity needs to be reduced from a convention framework, then deleting a *Specific Prescription Convention* will not provide much value, especially if there are no conflicting conventions or valid alternate interpretations.
