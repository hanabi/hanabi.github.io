# Goals for the Hyphen-ated Group

The *Hyphen-ated Group* is a loose collection of around 100-200 people who all love Hanabi, share the same conventions, and play pick-up games together.

As a group, we are always welcoming of new people that want to give our way-of-playing a try. With that said, we do not want to take-in just anybody. We take Hanabi very seriously, so **inclusiveness comes secondary to keeping our pick-up games of a high quality**.

<br />

The goals of the group as are follows:

### To Play At a High-Level

We want to get the highest scores possible. With that said, we know that the game is very hard, and that finding the best move all the time is nearly impossible. But we strive to do our best when we play and improve when we can.

It's not fun to play play with someone who is distracted and not focusing on the task at hand.

### To Not Cheat

It is possible to cheat in various ways, and it can range all the way from joking about the current game in a way that reveals information, all the way up to getting a friend to secretly tell you what your cards are.

Cheating ruins the game for us and has no place in our group.

### To Have Post-Game Reviews

After the game, we come together in a voice chat to review the game, turn by turn. This allows us to analyze the game and get better in a communal way. Often, a post-game review involves pointing out someone's individual mistakes. But everyone in the group understands that this is nothing personal! When one person makes a mistake, it is everyone at the table that learns from it. Lots of people in our group consider the post-game reviews to be even more fun than playing the game itself!

People who are not interested in attending and participanting in post-game reviews has no place in our group.

### To Use Voice Chat

Since we are playing the game with each other over the Internet, it is possible to do post-game reviews using text chat or voice chat.

Doing post-game reviews in text-chat really stinks. It takes much longer to communicate information, and things can get jumbled by everyone talking at the same time. In contrast, when talking to each other in a voice chat, we are able to quickly analyze the game in a collective way that is very efficient. Voice chat is a tool that unlocks the ability to really explore the game at a deep level, and is a one of the key reasons why people in our group have been able to elevate the game to such a high level.

We want everyone in our group to use voice chat during post-game reviews, and we encourage people who do not have a microphone to get one by whatever means possible.

### To Have Effective Communication

In order to be "good" at a post-game review, you have to be a good communicator. This involves communicating why you did something in a consise way without rambling. It involves having a good grasp of the English language. It involves having the ability to critcize others in a constructive way without making them feel bad. It involves using push-to-talk so that you don't accidently interupt other people when they are speaking. It involves being polite, kind, and empathetic to others.

Communication is difficult! But post-game reviews with good communication are a ton of fun and part of the reason that makes the games in our group high-quality. We are not interested in playing with people we can barely understand, people that are rude, and so on.

### To Have Fun

Ultimately, we all play the game because we find it fun. Earlier, I said that the *Hyphen-ated Group* takes Hanabi very seriously. But no-one wants to play with someone who takes the game *too* seriously. At the end of the day, the most important goal of the group is to provide an environment where everyone can have fun together, so it is important not to lose sight of that.
