## Bluff Types

### True Bluffs

A "normal" _Bluff_ is when Alice clues Cathy with the intent to **lie to Bob**. Bob thinks that a _Finesse_ is occurring and that he is about to play the connecting card. Only after Bob blind-plays some other card is it revealed that Alice lied to him. Bluffs that cause a player to blind-play a non-connected card where a connected card would be expected are called _True Bluffs_.

### Call-Out Bluffs

There are other types of _Bluffs_ where Alice does not lie to Bob. Instead, it is possible for Alice to **lie to Cathy**, the player receiving the clue. The _Bluffed_ player must blind-play a card in order to demonstrate to Cathy that she was lied to. This is called a _Call-Out Bluff_, as the player who blind-plays is "calling out" the lie.

A _Trash Bluff_ is the best example of a _Call-Out Bluff_. _Ejections_ and _Discharges_ are also considered to be _Call-Out Bluffs_; the only difference from a regular _Call-Out Bluff_ is that the blind-play comes from the _Second Finesse Position_ or the _Third Finesse Position_, respectively.

### Pseudo-Bluffs

There are yet other kinds of _Bluffs_ where **no-one (neither Bob nor Cathy) is lied to**. However, something strange about the clue is taken as a signal for the next player to blind-play their _Finesse Position_ card. This is called a _Pseudo-Bluff_.

A _Rank Choice Bluff_ is an example of a _Pseudo-Bluff_.

### Pseudo-Finesse

When a player happens to play a "connecting" card into a _Pseudo-Bluff_, it is a _Pseudo-Finesse_. (This is different from a "normal" _Finesse_, because the player in _Bluff Seat_ has no reason to believe that the card that they are playing will necessarily connect.

## Deferring Bluffs

Different things will happen if different kinds of _Bluffs_ are deferred.

### True Bluffs

- A True Bluff is always an instruction to blind-play, regardless of whether the blind-play is supposed to come from _Bluff Seat_ or not. This means that multiple players may think that they supposed to play from a _True Bluff_ clue.
- If a player misses a _True Bluff_ and does something else, then unless they did something that was more urgent than playing into the _Bluff_ (such as saving a critical card), the next player will likely assume that they are the ones supposed to blind-play and will do so.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Alice initiates a _Bluff_ by giving a clue to Donald.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy will assume that it was a _Finesse_ on her. She misplays her _Finesse Position_ card.

### Call-Out Bluffs

- A _Call-Out Bluff_ specifically requires the player in _Bluff Seat_ to call attention to the _Bluff_. Unlike a _True Bluff_, it does **not** instruct any other player to play.
- If a player misses a _Call-Out Bluff_, nobody else will blind-play. The lie will also likely lead to a misplay (unless it is fixed). It cannot be fixed by a blind-play, even from the same player on a later turn.

### Pseudo-Bluffs

- Similar to a _Call-Out Bluff_, a _Pseudo-Bluff_ specifically requires the player in _Bluff Seat_ to call attention to the _Bluff_. It does **not** instruct any other player to play.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Alice initiates a _Rank Choice Bluff_ by giving a clue to Cathy.
  - Bob discards, interpreting the move as a _Reverse Finesse_ on Donald.
  - Cathy will not misplay anything and wait for Donald to blind-play his _Finesse Position_.
