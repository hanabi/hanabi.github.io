## Bluff Types

### True Bluffs

A "normal" *Bluff* is when Alice clues Cathy with the intent to **lie to Bob**. Bob thinks that a *Finesse* is occurring and that he is about to play the connecting card. Only after Bob blind-plays some other card is it revealed that Alice lied to him. Bluffs that cause a player to blind-play a non-matching card where a matching card would be expected are called *True Bluffs*.

### Call-Out Bluffs

There are other types of *Bluffs* where Alice does not lie to Bob. Instead, it is possible for Alice to **lie to Cathy**, the player receiving the clue. The *Bluffed* player must blind-play a card in order to demonstrate to Cathy that she was lied to. This is called a *Call-Out Bluff*, as the player who blind-plays is "calling out" the lie.

A *Trash Bluff* is the best example of a *Call-Out Bluff*. *Ejections* and *Discharges* are also considered to be *Call-Out Bluffs*; the only difference from a regular *Call-Out Bluff* is that the blind-play comes from the *Second Finesse Position* or the *Third Finesse Position*, respectively.

### Pseudo-Bluffs

There are yet other kinds of *Bluffs* where **no-one (neither Bob nor Cathy) is lied to**. However, something strange about the clue is taken as a signal for the next player to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card. This is called a *Pseudo-Bluff*.

A *Rank Choice Bluff* is an example of a *Pseudo-Bluff*.

### Pseudo-Finesse

When a player happens to play a "matching" card into a *Pseudo-Bluff*, it is a *Pseudo-Finesse*. (This is different from a "normal" *Finesse*, because the player in *Bluff Seat* has no reason to believe that the card that they are playing will necessarily match.

## Deferring Bluffs

Different things will happen if different kinds of *Bluffs* are deferred.

### True Bluffs

- A True Bluff is always an instruction to blind-play, regardless of whether the blind-play is supposed to come from *Bluff Seat* or not. This means that multiple players may think that they supposed to play from a *True Bluff* clue.
- If a player misses a *True Bluff* and does something else, then unless they did something that was more urgent than playing into the *Bluff* (such as saving a critical card), the next player will likely assume that they are the ones supposed to blind-play and will do so.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Alice initiates a *Bluff* by giving a clue to Donald.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy will assume that it was a *Finesse* on her. She misplays her *Finesse Position* card.

### Call-Out Bluffs

- A *Call-Out Bluff* specifically requires the player in *Bluff Seat* to call attention to the *Bluff*. Unlike a *True Bluff*, it does **not** instruct any other player to play.
- If a player misses a *Call-Out Bluff*, nobody else will blind-play. The lie will also likely lead to a misplay (unless it is fixed). It cannot be fixed by a blind-play, even from the same player on a later turn.

### Pseudo-Bluffs

- Similar to a *Call-Out Bluff*, a *Pseudo-Bluff* specifically requires the player in *Bluff Seat* to call attention to the *Bluff*. It does **not** instruct any other player to play.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Alice initiates a *Rank Choice Bluff* by giving a clue to Cathy.
  - Bob discards, interpreting the move as a *Reverse Finesse* on Donald.
  - Cathy will not misplay anything and wait for Donald to blind-play his *Finesse Position*.
