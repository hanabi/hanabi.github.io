# The Plateau Effect

Hanabi may be unlike anything you've learned before.

In learning some things, progress is linear. Let's take the example of training for a footrace. In your first week of doing mile-long runs, your times might be around 10 minutes. But after a few weeks, it might drop to 9 minutes. And drop again to 8 minutes after a few more weeks. This is great - as a runner looking to improve, you have a clear, quantitative indication of your progress. And it is motivating to know that you are for-sure improving.

In learning other things, progress is not quite so straightforward. Hanabi is interesting in that almost all players **do not** learn in the way outlined in the previous example. Typically, players will *plateau* at a certain skill level, making the **exact same mistake** over and over. And then, after a period of no observable increase in skill, they will make a breakthrough - the thing that they consistently messed up over and over is now effortless. Some games are just like this, and it is pretty bizzare if you have never experienced it before.

For example, one of the first things that people usually *plateau* on is the ability to "see" *Finesses* - new players will **always** miss *Finesses* directed at them. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't a big deal, because it can be a good learning experience. But even after an in-depth *Finesse* explanation is given in the post-game review, the new player will go on to miss another *Finesse* in the next game. Why aren't they learning from their mistake? Because they have *plateaued*.

In this scenario, it's obviously going to be frustrating for the *Finesse*-missing player. They are going to feel dumb that they keep making the same mistake. They are going to feel like they are not making any progress. And when playing games, they will have to devote much of their mental energy to try and figure out if every single clue given is a *Finesse* or not.

But after a week or so of this, the new skills will have had time to settle, and something will "click" in their brain. All of a sudden, the player will realize that seeing *Finesses* is trivial - they are automatically playing into them without thinking about it at all. We could say that the player has had a break-through and is no longer *plateaued*.

Of course, there is much more to Hanabi than just seeing *Finesses*. After their breakthrough, the player will find that they consistently make some new mistake, like failing to see an *Order Chop Move*. And now, all of their mental energy previously devoted to seeing *Finesses* is now devoted to seeing *Order Chop Moves*. And so the cycle repeats.

Why is it important to talk about the *Plateau Effect*? As a newer player, you might have already realized that Hanabi is like Chess - easy to learn, but deep enough that it might take months (or years) to master. That's what makes it so much fun to play over and over. But in Hanabi, the process of *learning how to play the game itself* is **non-linear**. Meaning that not only will you make mistakes, but you will make **the same mistakes** over and over. You will get stuck.

And that's what this blog is about. Getting stuck is normal, so you shouldn't feel discouraged. All of the experienced players have made all of the same mistakes you have, and hundreds of other ones, besides. They know that "levelling up" is a long process. And if you continue to play, the reward from breaking through can be quite meaningful.

The above passages are mostly directed at beginners, but the general advice of "don't give up" can similarly be directed at intermediate players. Just like leveling up in an RPG, each successive *plateau* will take an even longer period of grinding out games to overcome. Intermediate players might come to the conclusion that they will just never be as good as the more experienced players. But this is just because the later *plateaus* take months of playing to surpass.
