## Push-to-Talk History

### The Beginning

The following is the story of why we use push-to-talk in the *Hyphenated Group*:

- Alice, Bob, Cathy, and Donald played Hanabi together every day. They played online using the website of [Hanab Live](https://hanab.live) and used [Discord](https://discord.com/) for voice-chat.
- As a group, they developed norms and a shared culture.
- As a group, they experimented with using Discord's "push-to-talk" feature instead of using the default of "voice activation".
- They found that there were all kinds of non-obvious benefits to using push-to-talk:
  - It cut out on static.
  - It reduced people talking over each other.
  - It prevented teammates from hearing interruptions (like sneezing, or a spouse walking into the room).
- The group found that after a week or two of using push to talk, the inconvenience of pressing a button faded away, and it became as effortless to press a button as it was to breathe. Because it was so effortless, it did not diminish any of the normal friendly conversations - it only cut out the inappropriate interruptions.
- As a group, the use of push-to-talk became part of the norms and shared culture. The group saw it as a sign of respect towards each other - they respected each other enough to volunteer extra effort in order to minimize rude sounds and the discomfort of others.

### Resisting Change

Using the push-to-talk feature is sometimes controversial. It usually goes something like this:

- One day, Emily started playing with the Hanabi group. She asked if she could use voice-activation instead of push-to-talk.
- Naturally, the rest of the group was a little wary of this. "Emily, we don't normally use voice-activation here. Why do you prefer voice-activation over push to talk? Maybe there is some important aspect that we have overlooked."
- Emily is a little stumped. "Well, there isn't anything super-specific. I just personally find it to be a bit more convenient is all. Since I use voice-activation in other contexts, I will often have to go into my Discord settings and change the setting from where it already is."
- This put Alice, Bob, Cathy, and Donald in a conundrum. They knew it was important to accommodate new people. But at the same time, they felt that it was important to maintain their shared norms and culture, and push-to-talk was a small-but-not-insignificant part of that.
- In this case, Alice and the gang politely asked Emily to change to push-to-talk. Emily realized that she liked playing with the group a lot, and that changing the Discord setting was not too much to ask in this case, even if it was inconvenient for her or not what she was personally used to.

## F.A.Q.

#### I play Hanabi from a tablet or a phone where it is not possible to use push-to-talk. What should I do?

In the *H-Group*, we take Hanabi very seriously, with some of us having played for hundreds or thousands of hours. When we play, we generally use computers with headsets to play with each other. This results for the best possible shared experience for everybody. We recognize that some people want to play Hanabi more casually with a tablet or a phone. And that's fine! But in general, we do not want our group to be cater to those kinds of people, and we don't want to change the norms of the group to accommodate those kinds of people. Instead, we encourage those people to take Hanabi more seriously and find a computer of their own with a proper headset to play, just like the rest of us do.

Unfortunately, this is necessarily exclusionary in order to maintain a high-quality playing experience for our members. Also see the *Exceptions* section below.

#### I play Hanabi from a work computer (or some other computer) where I cannot use install Discord properly, and thus cannot use push-to-talk. What should I do?

In the *H-Group*, we take Hanabi very seriously. When we play, we generally use our own personal computers to play with each other, and we do so in contexts where we can devote our full attention to the game and to each other. In general, playing video games with your friends while at work is inappropriate, and while it can be fine in some contexts, we do not want our group to cater to those kinds of contexts. Instead, we encourage people in this situation to wait until they are at home in order to play Hanabi with us, or work towards getting getting a laptop of their own.

Unfortunately, this is necessarily exclusionary in order to maintain a high-quality playing experience for our members. Also see the *Exceptions* section below.

#### Exceptions

As of December 2021, the *H-Group* Discord server has one "No PTT" voice channel. This channel is intended to be used for exceptional circumstances.

For example, some of our most-active members sometimes go on vacation, and only have access to their phone. Or, some of our most-active members like to play using a tablet from time to time. Longstanding *H-Group* members who normally use push-to-talk and have otherwise contributed to the group in a major way have earned the right to occasionally play with voice-activation as an exception to the normal rule.
