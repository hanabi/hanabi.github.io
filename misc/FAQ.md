<br />

### Are there 2-player conventions for the _H-Group_?

[Yes](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/2-player.md).

<br />

### What is the reason to play 1's in the starting hand from right-to-left (instead of from left-to-right)?

See the [convention reasons document](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/convention-reasons.md#play-order-of-multiple-1s).

<br />

### I found a bug on the website. What should I do?

- First, [do a search](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/issues) to see if someone has already posted an issue about the bug.
- If there is not an existing issue, then [make one](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/issues/new). (You will need to create a free GitHub account.)

### Why isn't [situation X] defined in the convention docs?

<!-- lint enable no-undefined-references -->

Not everything has to have a meaning. We intentionally want to have situations be undefined so that we have some wiggle room to handle a wide variety of game states. Read [the goals of the conventions](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/convention-goals.md).

### [Situation X] is undefined in the convention docs. I want to propose a new convention to define what it will mean.

<!-- lint enable no-heading-punctuation no-undefined-references -->

Not everything has to have a meaning. We intentionally want to have situations be undefined so that we have some wiggle room to handle a wide variety of game states. Read [the goals of the conventions](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/convention-goals.md).

<br />

### In what order should 1's be played?

Chop, fresh 1's left to right, opening 1's right to left.

<br />

### Am I allowed to perform a _2 Save_ or a _5 Save_ on someone who has a play?

Yes.

<br />

### Can a 2 be saved with a color clue if the other copy is in the trash?

Yes.

<br />

### What is the precedence of the different "5 moves"?

_5 Save_ > _5 Stall_ > _5 Chop Move_ > _5 Pull_

<br />

### Is a number 5 clue always a _5 Save_ on the chop card, if there are play clues available?

Yes.

<br />

### Does it matter who gives a _Save Clue_?

No. Unless it is super, super bad for one person to be giving it, then it would be a _Finesse_ or something.

<br />

### Why do _5 Stalls_ exist?

It means that random 3's and 4's on people's chop survive longer.

<br />

### What should I do in a _Double Discard Situation_ if there are no allowable stall clues to give?

Discard. Alternatively, you could try cluing a useful 3 and getting a strike, if you can see that a misplayed card would be trash.

<br />

### Are all _Finesses_ by a _5-Pulled_ player _Certain Finesses_?

Yes.

<br />

### If a _5 Pull_ touches slot 1 and slot 3 in 3-player game, does this call for a blind-play on slot 2 or slot 4?

Slot 2.

<br />

### Is known-trash considered to be the chop card?

No. Even if you have a known safe discard, your chop is still the right-most unclued card.

<br />

### If my chop is _Finessed_, does it still count as chop?

No.

<br />

### Does discarding known-trash end the _Early Game_?

No, only discarding an unknown card from chop does.

<br />

### Does misplaying end the _Early Game_?

No, only discarding an unknown card from chop does.

<br />

### If I have a clued card in my hand that is _Chop Moved_ in someone else's hand, should I perform a _Sarcastic Discard_?

No, they will misplay their _Finesse Position_ as a _Gentleman's Discard_. This forces someone else on the team to waste a clue as a _Fix_.

<br />

### When should a _Fix Clue_ be done?

Anytime. Doesn't necessarily have to be early, doesn't necessarily have to be done "just in time".

<br />

### Who should give a _Fix Clue_ when a player performs a _Finesse with a Lie Component_?

- Almost always, the player who initiated the move.
- Alternatively, someone else on the time can also give a _Fix Clue_ if they are "in" on the lie, meaning that they see both copies of the card, etc.

<br />

### If I am _Finessed_, and I get a _Fix Clue_ to stop me from bombing my _Finesse Position_, and the _Fix Clue_ touches my chop and some other card, which one should I play into the _Finesse_?

You should not play the chop. You should play the card that is closest to your _Finesse Position_.

### I receive a clue that touches several cards and focuses on chop. Later I am _Prompted_. Which card should I play?

Left-most.

<br />

### Should I always _Chop Move_ after receiving a _Tempo Clue_?

No! There are **four** conditions where _Tempo Clues_ are allowed. If [any of these four conditions](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-6#the-valuable-tempo-clue) are true, then you should not _Chop Move_.

<br />

### Does _[Schrodinger's Cat Principle](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-5/#schr%C3%B6dingers-cat-principle)_ always take priority over _[Occam's Razor](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-10/#clue-interpretation--occams-razor)_?

Yes.

<br />

### What does "one-away-from-playable" mean?

- For example, a red 4 is one-away-from-playable if the red 2 is played.
- For example, a red 4 is one-away-from-playable if the red 1 is played and the red 3 is already clued in someone's hand.

<br />

### A card has a positive number 3 clue on it. It is clued again with red, which fills in the card. A red 1 blind-plays. Is it a _Finesse_ or a _Bluff_?

- It does not matter if the card is "new" or if it has a clue on it already.
- All that matters is if the clue connects to the blind-play.
- Here, a red 1 connects to a red color clue, so it is a _Finesse_.

<br />

### A card has a positive red clue on it. It is clued again with number 3, which fills in the card. A red 1 blind-plays. Is it a _Finesse_ or a _Bluff_?

- It does not matter if the card is "new" or if it has a clue on it already.
- All that matters is if the clue connects to the blind-play.
- Here, a red 1 does not connect to a number 3 clue, so it is a _3 Bluff_.

<br />

### Can I perform a _Certain Finesse_ from _Bluff Seat_?

No.

<br />

### Should I play all known-playable clued cards before blind-playing _Finesse Position_ in case it is a _Layered Finesse_?

No. You must blind-play immediately.

<br />

### If I have _Elimination Notes_, and receive a clue that identifies the exact position of this card, and other cards are touched, are the other cards promised to be playable?

No. The clue is only focused on the card with the _Elimination Notes_.

<br />

### Can you do an _Elimination Finesse_ on the second card of a _Double Finesse_?

Yes. Any type of _Finesse_ can be an _Elimination Finesse_.

<br />

### What takes precedence: a _Finesse_ through a touched card, or a _Hard Bluff_?

_Hard Bluff_.

<br />

### What takes precedence: a _Finesse with a Lie Component_ or a _Patch Finesse_?

Everything takes precedence over a _Patch Finesse_.

<br />

### Can I delay playing into a _Finesse_ to perform a _Gentleman's Discard_?

No. You are only allowed to delay playing into a _Finesse_ if you are performing a _Finesse_ or a _Bluff_.

<br />

### Why does _Gentleman's Discard_ only get the matching card instead of all of the various possibilities?

Because the discarding player might have asymmetric information about the identity of the card. In other words, they may have information that you do not know.

<br />

### Can I discard a _Finessed_ card as a _Gentleman's Discard_?

No. It could also be a _Layered Finesse_ on you. The only time you are ever allowed to blind-discard _Finesse Position_ is in response to a _Certain Finesse_.

<br />

### Can I discard a _Finessed_ card if the _Finesse_ is ambiguous and I want to pass it back?

No. It could also be a _Layered Finesse_ on you. The only time you are ever allowed to blind-discard _Finesse Position_ is in response to a _Certain Finesse_.

<br />

### Can I pass back an _Ambiguous Finesse_ that was passed back to me?

No.

<br />

### Can blind-playing a card from a _Gentleman's Discard_ trigger _Priority_?

Yes. Playing a card from a _Gentleman's Discard_ does not count as blind-playing a card.

<br />

### Which has _Priority_: red 3 or blue 5 while the team is at 8 clues?

Red 3, so the extra clue from the 5 is not wasted.

<br />

### Which has _Priority_: red 3 or green 4 if both red 4's have been discarded?

Green 4. The red 3 does not count as being a "lower rank" card in this case. It is equivalent in rank to a 5.

<br />

### Should I play my _Finesse Position_ into a _Priority Finesse_ if I see the connecting card in the middle of someone else's hand?

- No. A _Load Clue_ takes precedence over a _Priority Finesse_ or a _Priority Bluff_.
- The only exception is if the card is uncluable (e.g. blocked on both sides).

<br />

### Alice has two playable 5s and plays the right-most. Is it a _Known Bluff_?

Playing 5s not in the left-to-right order is considered to be a known mistake.

<br />

### Can I _Bluff_ a clued card?

No. Playing a clued card does not "prove" anything because the player might have found out that the card was playable through some other read.

<br />

### Can I perform a _Reverse Double Bluff_?

Only if both blind-plays would happen immediately. (e.g. Alice clues Bob, Bob blind-plays, Cathy blind-plays.)

<br />

### Can I perform a _Priority Bluff_ that gets a blind-play of a card that is clued in my hand or clued in someone else's hand?

No. That is defined as a _Layered Priority Finesse_.

<br />

### Can I perform a _Layered Baton Discard_?

No. After a _Baton Discard_ happens, any follow-up _Finesses_ will skip over the slot promised from the _Baton Discard_.

<br />

### If a clue is clearly a _Bad Touch_, does it promise the missing card on _Finesse Position_?

No. It only promises that the missing cards are in your hand. Write _Trash Touch Elimination Notes_.

<br />

### What is the reason behind discarding trash from left to right?

See [the convention reasons document](convention-reasons.md#discarding-trash-from-left-to-right).

<br />

### Are _Loaded Play Clues_ turned on for brown cards, even if it is the _Early Game_ and there is nothing else to do?

Yes.

<br />

### Is it allowed to perform a _Locked Hand Save_ on a brown card?

Yes.

<br />

### Does _Good Touch Principle_ apply to pink cards?

Yes.

<br />

### Which convention takes precedence: _Bubblegum Bluff_ or a _Trash Finesse_ / _Unknown Trash Discharge_ / _4 Charm_?

Variant-specific take precedence over non-variant-specific conventions.

<br />

### If I am _Prompted_ for a card, but I got a _Save Clue_ earlier for that color/rank, what do I do?

- If you get a _Save Clue_ on a chop card and you can narrow down the possibilities to one exact card, then:
  - You should write a note on the card for that exact possibility.
  - If the card is _Prompted_ later, then you can skip over other cards in your hand and play that exact card.
- If you get a _Save Clue_ on a chop card and there are two or more possibilities, then:
  - You should write a note on the card for all of the possibilities. The card is now in a _superposition_.
  - If you are _Prompted_ later on for a card that matches one of the possibilities, then:
    - If all of the possibilities in the _superposition_ are now playable, then you should play the card from the original _Save Clue_ first. If that was not the card, then you can continue playing cards left-to-right.
    - If not all of the possibilities in the _superposition_ are playable, then you should simply play cards from left-to-right. (The _Prompt_ does not collapse the _superposition_ if it could apply to other cards.)

<br />

### In variants with a pink suit, if I have cards in my hand that only have a rank clue on them, which ones am I allowed to play?

- You can only play cards with a number 1 clue on them.
  - If a card with a number 1 clue on it happens to be some other unplayable pink card, then someone else on the team is required to give a _Pink Fix Clue_.
- You are not allowed to play cards with a number 2 clue on them, a number 3 clue on them, etc. (Because they could be a pink 5.)
  - No-one else on the team is expected to give a _Pink Fix Clue_ in this case.)

<br />

### In variants with a pink suit, If 1's were clued in my hand, and all of the 1's are already played, should I play my next number 1 card as a pink 2?

No. You should hold on to it for later. It could be any other useful pink card.
