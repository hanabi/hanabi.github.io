# Goals for the Hyphen-ated Conventions

What are the stated goals of the Hyphen-ated conventions? You could start off by saying that the goal is just to "increase win-rate", but it is a little more nuanced than that.

Like most Hanabi groups, when the Hyphen-ated group started playing together, there were no conventions at all. Only after a few games did we start to agree on some very simple conventions - discard the right-most card, save 5's using a number 5 clue, and so forth. Doing this increased the win-rate drastically and also made the game more fun to play. Next, we started to agree on more things, like *Finesses*, *Bluffs*, and so forth. Again, this both increased the win-rate and increased the enjoyment of the game - it is quite fun to perform big *Finesses*!

As the months went by, we continued to play Hanabi, and we were exposed to more and more kinds of situations. Naturally, we continued to refine the existing conventions and continued to come up with new strategies, like the *2 Save* convention and the *Hidden Finesse*. This continued the trend of increasing win-rate and incresing the enjoyment of the game. However, it also increased the overall complexity of playing with the group. We started to notice a down-side: getting new players up-to-speed with how to use all of the "special moves" was getting more and more complicated.

As the months turned into years, our group's convention framework never stagnated. Happily, Hanabi is a deep enough game that we never stopped finding new ways to optimize our play. Even though it took a while for beginners to learn some of the more advanced stuff, that was okay - the goal of the group was to push Hanabi as far as it could go, maximizing win-rate as much as possible and squeezing every little bit of value out of what we had to work with. 

However, this was not destined to last forever. Eventually, with more and more moves being invented, we got to the point where even the expert players had difficulty keeping all of the conventions in their head at the same time. We realized that there was an upper limit on how much complexity that a group could reasonably have. It follows that there is a "cost" associated with each convention or each special move that you have in your repertoire. Previous to this insight, we would always implement a convention if it would increase win-rate. But now, we realized that with every particular convention, we would have to weigh the overall value that it granted against the cost of how complicated it was to remember and to use.

Separate from all of this, Floris van Doorn starting playing Hanabi with our group in 2017. Hailing from the Netherlands, he was passionate about Hanabi and showed us how to play with an entirely separate convention framework called [Hat Guessing](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Hat_Guessing.md). It was a fun new challenge to re-learn how to play Hanabi with this new framework. And it was also extremely powerful - in 5-player games, every clue had the potential to get four cards played.

Playing with Hat Guessing was quite fun, but not fun enough to want to play with it all the time - or even most of the time. It requires constant use of modular mathematics and it did not come naturally to most people. The Hyphen-ated group returned to playing the "normal" way and only ventured back to playing with Hat Guessing on rare occasions.

The story of Hat Guessing is relevant because if the goal of the group was to only to maximize win-rate, then we would simply play with Hat Guessing all the time. But Hanabi is a game, and we want to have as much fun playing it as possible. So with all of that in mind, we could say that the goal of the convention framework is three-fold:

1. To maximize win-rate
	- We are Hanabi enthusiasts and we care about optimizing our play to win the maximum number of games possible.
	- Optimizing win-rate too much can take the fun out of the game, so there is a balance involved.

2. To minimize complexity
	- We want to make conventions that are intuitive and easy to remember.
	- If a convention is complicated but increases win-rate by a lot, then that is an okay tradeoff.

3. To have fun
	- Having lots of conventions can be fun, because it raises the skill cap and provides a deeper challenge than just playing surface-level Hanabi.
	- It can be fun to make people blind-play cards in new and exciting ways.
	- Too much complexity can be overwhelming and not very fun, so there is a balance involved.
