## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

@everyone Renamed conventions:

**Critical 4 Bluff** (rename) (by Romain)

- The *Critical 4 Bluff* is renamed to the *Critical Color Bluff*.
- The convention has been reworded from applying "only to 4's" to applying to "any critical card that is not a 5". The consequence of the either wording is the same, so this is only a cosmetic change.
- The one exception is that in *Up or Down* variants, you can now perform *Critical Color Bluffs* on a 2.

@everyone Moved conventions:

- *5 Stalls* are moved from level 1 to level 2.
- *Finesses* with a *Lie Component* are moved from level 22 to "extras".
