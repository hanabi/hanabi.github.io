## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

<br />

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

@everyone Deleted conventions:

**The 5 Double Pull** (deleted)

- This was deleted since it conflicted with the new *Playful Ignition* convention.

@everyone New conventions:

**The Playful Ignition** (by pianoblook)

- If a playable card is on chop, the natural thing to do is to give it a *Chop-Focus Play Clue*. If a player *Chop Moves* the playable card instead, this is very strange. If there is not a good reason to do so, then the cluer is trying to communicate something extra.
- In this situation, they intend for an *Ignition* on the next player. Since a *Chop Move* causes a blind-play, the *Chop Moved* player will know that the *Chop Moved* card is playable.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: blue 4, blue 4, blue 5, red 1
  - Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a blue 5 on slot 3.
  - It is now Bob's turn. Bob sees that since there were other *Play Clues* for Alice to give, Cathy will interpret this as an *Early 5's Chop Move*.
  - Bob also knows that it is nonsensical to *Chop Move* a playable red 1 - Alice could have just give a red *Chop-Focus Play Clue* to the red 1.
  - Thus, this must be a *Playful Ignition*. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that if this was an *Early 5's Chop Move*, then Bob would not have blind-played anything. Since he blind-played his *Finesse Position* card, this must be a *Playful Ignition*. Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card (the card to the right of the clued 5).
- Sometimes, it can be useful to *Chop Move* a playable card. Something is only a *Playful Ignition* if there is not some other good reason for the *Chop Move*. Specifically, the player might want to:
  - Avoid violating *Good Touch Principle*.
  - Save a *Delayed Playable* card that is followed by a critical card.
  - Save two important cards when there are a lot of cards to deal with and the team is low on clues.
  - Get a blind-play from *Elimination* when the duplicate is visible.

**The Playful Ignition Interaction with 5 Rank Clues** (by pianoblook)

- Normally, a number 5 rank clue to a 5 that is one-away-from-chop would be either:
  - a *5 Stall*
  - a *5's Chop Move*
  - a *Play Clue* on the 5
- If a *5 Stall* is impossible (i.e. it is not a stalling situation), then a *5's Chop Move* on a playable card would normally be treated as a *Play Clue* on the 5.
- However, for level 20 players, *Play Clues* like this are **turned off**. In other words, every number 5 clue that focuses a 5 that is exactly one-away-from-chop would always be a *5's Chop Move*. This is referred to as the *Playful Ignition Interaction*.
- The *Playful Ignition Interaction* can be tricky for players, since *Playful Ignitions* can look like normal *Finesses*. Players need to remember that the blind-play relates to the card being *Chop Moved*, not the 5 directly.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the *Mid-Game*.
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: blue 4, blue 4, blue 5, blue 1
  - Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching the blue 5 on slot 3.
  - Bob expected Alice to clue number 1 to Cathy. Thus, this must be a *Playful Ignition*. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is red 4 and it successfully plays.
  - From Cathy's perspective, she first thought that Alice's clue was a *5's Chop Move*. However, if that were the case, Bob would not have blind-played anything.
  - Furthermore, Cathy knows that *Play Clues* on 5's one-away-from-chop using rank clues are turned off. Thus, Bob's blind-play must indicate a *Playful Ignition*.
  - Thus, Cathy's 5 can be any color (including blue). Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card.
- Importantly, this interaction is **turned off** in the *End-Game*.
- Note that sometimes, players will use a rank 5 clue to touch an actual playable 5 that is exactly one-away-from-chop. Regardless of whether or not the 5 is playable, the next player needs to react as if it wasn't playable. (This is because it is agreed that all *Play Clue* interpretations are turned off.)

***Trash Order Chop Moves* after *Unknown Dupe Discharges***

- If an *Unknown Dupe Discharge* touches exactly two brand-new cards, then both of them must be the same copy.
- In this situation, the player is expected to discard the focus of the clue.
- If they do not discard the focus of the clue, they are performing a *Trash Order Chop Move* on the next player.

## The Backlog (Variant-Specific Conventions)

@everyone New variant-specific conventions:

**The White Loaded Play Clue** (by rkass)

- This convention only applies to variants with a white suit.
- *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned on" for white cards.
- Normally, *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned off" in the *Early Game*. However, note that *Loaded Play Clues* **always** apply to white cards, even in the *Early Game*.
- This means that if a player is *Loaded*, and a *Chop-Focused* card *could* be white, then they will always assume that it is a *White Loaded Play Clue*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - White 2 is played on the stacks. Blue 3 is in the trash.
  - Bob has a globally-known playable red 1 in his hand.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a 3 on Bob's chop.
  - Normally, Bob would interpret this as an *Early Save* on the blue 3.
  - However, Bob knows that white 3 is currently playable and that he is *Loaded*. Thus, this must be a *White Loaded Play Clue* on a white 3.
- As an exception, *White Loaded Play Clues* do not apply to number 5 clues in the *Low Score Phase*.

**The White Loaded Self-Finesse** (by rkass)

- This convention only applies to variants with a white suit.
- Since players will always assume *White Loaded Play Clues*, you can also use them to perform *Self-Finesses*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - White 1 is played on the stacks. Blue 3 is in the trash.
  - Bob has a globally-known playable red 1 in his hand.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a 3 on Bob's chop.
  - Normally, Bob would interpret this as an *Early Save* on the blue 3.
  - However, Bob knows that he is *Loaded* and that this 3 could be a white 3. Thus, this must be a *White Loaded Play Clue* on a white 3.
  - Bob does not see any white 2's, so he knows that he must have the white 2 as a *Self-Finesse*. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position*. It is a white 2 and it successfully plays.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Cathy red, touching a red 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob clues Cathy number 2, touching a 2 on her chop.
  - Normally, Cathy would interpret this as an *Early 2 Save* on any 2 in the game.
  - However, Cathy knows that she is *Loaded* and that the 2 could be a white 2. Thus, this must be a *White Loaded Play Clue* on a white 2.
  - Bob does not see any white 1's, so he knows that he must have the white 1 as a *Self-Finesse*. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position*. It is a white 1 and it successfully plays.

**Prism Color Finesses (One-Away-From-Playable)** (by Zamiel)

- This convention only applies to variants with a prism suit.
- For the purposes of *Finesses*, prism cards only "connect" if they are the direct next color.
- For example, in a 3-player game of *Prism (5 Suits)*:
  - Prism 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues green to Cathy, touching a prism 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays a prism 2 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy knows that since prism 3 is green, prism 2 connects to green. Thus, this must be a *Finesse*.
  - Cathy plays her green as a prism 3.

**Prism Color Bluffs (Two-Away-From-Playable)** (by Zamiel)

- Players can perform a *Bluff* on a prism card with a color, as long as that color represents a prism card that is *two-or-more-away-from-playable*.
- As a consequence of this, you can *Bluff* a prism 1 by cluing a prism 3 (with color).
- For example, in a 3-player game of *Prism (5 Suits)*:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues green to Cathy, touching a prism 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays a prism 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy knows that prism 1 would connect to yellow, but it does not connect to green. Thus, this is just a *Bluff*.
  - Cathy marks her green card as either a green 2 (as a normal *Bluff*, a green 3 (as a *3 Bluff*), or a prism 3 (as a *Hard 3 Bluff*).

**The Turnabout Ejection (for 1's and 5's)** (by pianoblook)

- If a player uses *Pink Promise* to falsely indicate a pink 1 as a pink 5 **or** a pink 5 as a pink 1, this is a dangerous lie that must be immediately resolved.
- In this situation, the next player must immediately play their *Second Finesse Position* to prove what happened. This is called a *Turnabout Ejection*.
- After the *Ejection*, the player who received the clue will know that the focused card's identity has been "reversed".
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, which touches a pink 1 on Cathy's chop.
  - Bob knows that Alice is violating *Pink Promise*. This must be a *Turnabout Ejection*.
  - Bob blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position* (slot 2). It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - At first, Cathy thought that the number 5 clue from Alice was a *5 Save*.
  - After Bob blind-plays, Cathy knows that Alice did not perform a *5 Save* and instead did something else.
  - Cathy knows that Alice did not perform a *Bubblegum Bluff*, because Bob would have played his slot 5 card instead of his slot 2 card.
  - Thus, Cathy knows that this must be a *Turnabout Ejection*. She marks her slot 5 card as a pink 1.
- If a *Turnabout Ejection* occurs from a number 1 clue that also touches other 1s, the non-focused cards should still be assumed to be 1s (using the *1's Assumption* convention).

**Dark Omni & Gray Pink Saves**

- This convention only applies in variants with a dark omni or gray pink suit.
- The rules for saving dark omni and gray pink suits have been slightly refined so that players can perform more 2-for-1 clues.
- See the doc for more details: https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/variant-specific/dark-omni-&-gray-pink.md

**The Pink Fake Prompt & The Pink Fake Finesse** (by Jeff)

- This convention only applies to variants with a pink suit.
- First, see the section on the Pink Play Clue Lie.
- In the *Pink Play Clue Lie*, *Pink Promise* is violated when giving a *Play Clue* to a playable pink card. However, no special actions need to be taken from anyone else on the team, because the lie will automatically resolve when the card is played.
- In some special situations, it is possible to give a *Pink Play Clue Lie* that will **not** resolve automatically. In this situation, the next player must play a card to "fix" the lie.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice gives a number 2 clue to Cathy, touching a pink 1 on slot 2. (Cathy does not have a playable card on slot 1.)
  - Bob knows that if he does nothing, Cathy will go on to interpret this as a *Self-Finesse*, and play her *Finesse Position*, which will misplay.
  - Thus, Bob plays his *Finesse Position* as a *Pink Fake Finesse*. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - From Cathy's perspective, Alice performed a *Finesse* on the blue 1 into the blue 2. Cathy plays the blue 2, but it is actually the pink 1. Now, Cathy knows that Alice performed a *Pink Fake Finesse*.

**The Fake 5's Chop Move** (by pianoblook)

- This convention only applies to variants with a dark pink, dark omni, or gray pink suit.
- Players are allowed to violate *Pink Promise* on dark pink cards in order to perform a *Fake 5's Chop Move*.
- This means that *Pink Promise* no longer applies to off chop cards when they are clued as a 5, unless it was just a *5 Stall*.

**The Fake 5 Pull & The Fake 5 Number Discharge** (by pianoblook)

- This convention only applies to variants with a dark pink, dark omni, or gray pink suit.
- Similar to the Fake 5's Chop Move, players can also violate *Pink Promise* in order to initiate a *5 Pull* or a *5 Number Discharge*.
- Sometimes, when a *5 Pull* is occurring, it can be ambiguous to other players on the team as to whether a *5 Pull* or a *5 Stall* is happening. However, when a *Fake 5 Pull* (or a *Fake 5 Number Discharge*) is happening, everyone can be sure that it is a *5 Pull*, because it would be illegal to violate *Pink Promise* when performing a *5 Stall*.
