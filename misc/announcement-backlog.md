# Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

<br />

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

@everyone New conventions:

_The 5 Number Ejection_ and _The 5 Number Discharge_ (by pianoblook)

```text
- The old convention called the _5 Number Discharge_ has now been split up into two different conventions: the _5 Number Ejection and the _5 Number Discharge_.
- Now, when a _5 Pull_ happens, if the _5 Pulled_ card is:
  - _Playable_ --> _5 Pull_
  - _One-away-from-playable_ --> _5 Pull Finesse_
  - _Two-or-more-away-from-playable_ --> _5 Pull Ejection_
  - _Trash_ --> _5 Pull Discharge_
```

@everyone Deleted conventions:

_The Junk Discharge_ (deleted)

```text
- The _Junk Discharge_ has been deleted, since it is just the same thing as a _Unknown Trash Discharge_ or an _Unknown Dupe Discharge_.
```

@everyone New variant-specific conventions:

**Odds & Evens Prompt Rank Exception** (by Sturm)

```text
- This convention only applies to the Odds & Evens variants.
- Previously, _Prompts_ would not apply to a card if it had an odd clue on it.
- Now, _Prompts_ do not apply if the card only has one clue on it and it is an odd clue.
```

**The 5 Odd Ejection** (by Sturm)

```text
- This convention only applies to the Odds & Evens variants.
- An _Play Clue_ initiated with an odd clue to a 5 signals an _Ejection_ on the next player if they have to **blind-play two or more cards** to fulfill the _Finesse_. (This is similar to how _5 Color Ejection_ works.)
- The _Odd Prompt Rank Exception_ applies when counting the blind-plays.
- Players should be careful with odd clues focused on chop. Depending on if the _Always Loaded Principle_ applies, the clue can be a _Save Clue_, a _5 Odd Ejection_ or a _Rank Choice Ejection_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 4 is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy has a red card clued in her hand. From _Good Touch Principle_, she assumes that it is the red 5.
  - The only yellow card that both Alice and Bob see is Cathy's yellow 5.
  - Alice gives an odd clue to Cathy, touching a yellow 5 on chop.
  - Since Cathy is loaded with a playable red card, the _Always Loaded Principle_ applies. Therefore, the odd clue is a _Play Clue_ on the yellow 5.
  - Since Bob has to blind-play two or more cards to fulfill the _Finesse_, he knows this is a _5 Odd Ejection_. Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Cathy knows an _Ejection_ happened. The only ejection that matches this sequence is a _5 Odd Ejection_, so she marks her odd card as any non-red 5.
