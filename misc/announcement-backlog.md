# Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

<br />

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

@everyone Deleted conventions:

**Unnecessary Trash Finesse** & **Unnecessary Trash Bluff** (by pianoblook)

```text
- The special conventions called the **Unnecessary Trash Finesse** and the **Unnecessary Trash Bluff** are deleted.
- Now, all *Trash Finesses* and all *Trash Bluffs* are treated as unnecessary. In other words, all *Trash Finesses* and all *Trash Bluffs* perform *Chop Moves* or *Trash Pushes* when they are performed.
```

<br />

## The Backlog (Variant-Specific Conventions)

@everyone New variant-specific conventions:

**Red Fix Clue** (by Dr. Kakashi)

```text
- This convention only applies to omni-ones variants.
- Normally, when cards are re-clued with a red color clue, this would be interpreted as a _Tempo Clue_. However, in an omni-ones variant, this is instead interpreted as a _Fix Clue_.
- We arbitrarily choose red since it is the left-most color.
```

@everyone Changed conventions:

**Trash Finesse & Trash Bluff** (in Pink) (by str8tsknacker) <!-- cspell:ignore tsknacker -->

```text
- The exception for pink variants where not all of the cards are promised to be trash is deleted.
- Now, _Trash Finesses_ and _Trash Bluffs_ work identically do all other variants.
```
