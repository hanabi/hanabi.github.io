# Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](convention-changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog (General Conventions)

**2 Saves Off-Chop on the First Turn** (deleted)

- The convention where off-chop _2 Saves_ are permitted on the first turn is deleted.
- Now, if you do not have anything to do on the first turn, you must intentionally cause a misplay that will either get some side benefit or cause the least amount of damage.

## The Backlog (Variant-Specific Conventions)

@everyone Clarified variant-specific conventions:

**The Pink Play Clue Lie (on 5's) (Illegal)**

- This convention only applies to pink-fives & omni-fives
- First, see the section on the [_Pink Play Clue Lie_](pink.mdx#the-pink-play-clue-lie-ppcl-with-a-mismatched-play-clue-that-touches-other-cards).
- Even though it is not possible to clue number 5 in some special-fives variants, [_Pink Promise_](pink.mdx#pink-promise) still applies to the rank clues given. In other words, players are not expected to account for the possibility of a playable 5 when they receive a non-5 rank clue.
- Subsequently, if a player lies about the identity of a 5 with a _Pink Play Clue Lie_, it risks losing the game, since the receiving player might perform a _Gentleman's Discard_ (or be otherwise confused about the identity of the card in such a way that causes a cascading failure).
- For this reason, these kind of clues are only typically given as a last resort. (Color clues should be given instead in order to get a 5 to play.)
- In addition to _Pink Promise_ applying to rank clues on playable cards, it also applies to rank clues used on trash cards. In other words, a number 1 clue that indicates either a _Trash Chop Move_ or a play clue on a 5 would indicate the former.

**Rank Play Clues on 5s**

- This convention only applies to light-pink-fives.
- Pink Promise does not apply to rank clues that could represent a playable 5. Thus, when players receive a rank _Play Clue_, they have to account for the possibility of it being the true rank and the possibility of it being a playable 5.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 and blue 4 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a single card on slot 1.
  - Bob knows that this must be a _Play Clue_. Bob marks the card as either the red 3 or the blue 5.
