# Criteria for the Purple Role

The following is a rough set of criteria for someone receiving the purple role:

- Have played "actively" for at least 1 year.
  - Active is defined as playing at least a few games a week. However, we acknowledge that for most people, there will be periods of heavy activity and periods where no Hanabi is played at all.
  - Not playing any games for a 1+ month period would mean that the period is subtracted from the 1 year calculation.
  - The beginning point for measuring 1 year is the week that the person started playing regularly with one or more players who had a purple role at the time.
- Commonly plays "pick up" games with the general population.
- Participates in reviews using voice chat.
- Is a "good fit" for the role. (They embody the principles and culture of the group.)

The following is not relevant:

- Someone's skill level.
  - The purple role isn't meant to indicate that you are a good player - it just indicates that you have been around for a while and have assimilated our cultural values.
  - After one year of playing, some people will be better at the game than others. But this isn't a competition. Any person who has played for a while will know _most_ of the important conventions, and that's good enough.
- The amount of games played.
  - Some people play Hanabi more than others, but everyone has a life outside of the game. We don't think it is particularly healthy for people to shortcut the process by grinding out a massive amount of games. In general, we want people to continue playing with the group for long periods of time into the future that are not marked by short bursts of activity.
