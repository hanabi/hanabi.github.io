## Efficiency Tables

### Pace

- Pace is a measure of how many discards the team can do before a perfect score becomes impossible.
- The formula for pace is:
  - `total cards in the deck - ((number of cards in a player's hand - 1) * number of players) - (5 * number of suits)`
  - If a game contains the Contrarian detrimental character, `(number of players - 2)` is subtracted from the pace.

### Efficiency

- Efficiency is a measure of how much value the team is getting with the amount of clues that they have spent thus far.
- The formula for efficiency is:
  - `(number of cards played + number of cards with 1+ clues "on" them) / number of clues given or lost`
  - (This formula assumes the use of _Good Touch Principle_.)

- Minimum efficiency is defined as:
  - `total cards that need to be played / maximum number of clues that can be given before the game ends`
- The formula for minimum efficiency is:
  - `(5 * number of suits) / (8 + floor((starting pace + number of suits - unusable clues) / discards per clue))`
  - "unusable clues" is 1 by default, but 2 in a 5/6-player game
  - "unusable clues" is equal to the number of suits in a _Throw It in a Hole_ game
  - "unusable clues" is always 1 if a game contains a Contrarian detrimental character
  - "discards per clue" is 1 by default, but 2 in a _Clue Starved_ game
- To calculate the total number of clues given or lost, we use:
  - +8 for the 8 starting clues
  - starting pace because you get 1 clue per discard
  - number of suits because you get a clue back for each 5 played of the suit
  - unusable clues because you don't get to use the clue that you get for playing the final 5
  - unusable clues is 2 in a 5/6-player game because you cannot play 6 or 7 cards of the same suit in the final round
