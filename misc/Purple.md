# The Purple Role in Discord

If you are reading this, you are presumably being promoted to having the purple role in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp). Congradulations! And thanks for sticking around this long!

Zamiel "owns" the Discord server, but for most intents and purposes, we want the server to be governed in an egalitarian manner. For that reason, all purple people have administrative powers in the Discord. (Meaning that, for example, you can move people around in voice channels, delete other people's messages, and so forth.) But with **great power** comes **great responsibility**.

<br />

### Do

* Use common sense.
* Help moderate the chat. We expect all chatters to follow the rules posted in the `#rules-and-resources` channel.
  * For example, feel free to delete gore, porn, spam, and so forth.
* Ask in the `#moderator-only` channel before doing things like creating new channels, and so forth. If you aren't sure, just ask.

<br />

### Don't

* Don't power trip.
* Don't delete other people's posts unless there is a good reason.
* Don't be a dick. More on that below.

<br />

### The Culture

* Purple people are seen as embassadors of the Hyphen-ated group, and as embassadors of Hanabi more generally.
* Thus, we want purple people to outwardly reflect the values of the group - values that you presumably already know.

#### Politeness

* People play Hanabi from all over the world, so put in work to be polite. It can be easy to misinterpret someone if you can't see their face.

#### Kindness

* No-one wants to play games with someone who has a mean streak. Try to stay postiive.

#### Patience

* Your patience *will* be tested, especially by new players (and some more than others). But have a little empathy; we were all there once.

#### Inclusion

* Over time, players in this group retire, and they hardly ever come back. Without new players, **this group will die**.
* Be open to playing with new players, at least some of the time.

<br />

Purple people need to mix with green people so that our values continue to propigate. We want to avoid the nightmare scenario where a brand new player hops into a post-game review with a bunch of green people, and a yelling match ensues about who messed up the most, and the brand new player promptly leaves and never comes back. Do your part to help prevent this from occuring.

Thank you for being a part of the group that I love so much.
