- A *Discharge* refers to a blind-play in which someone plays a card from their *Third Finesse Position*.
  - For example, if a player's hand is completely unclued, their *Third Finesse Position* is slot 3.
- Just like a *Bluff*, a *Discharge* can only be performed on the very next player.

### The Unknown Trash Discharge (UTD)

- The _Unknown Trash Discharge_ is introduced at [level 16](../level-16.mdx#the-unknown-trash-discharge-1-for-1-form-utd).

### The Unknown Dupe Discharge (UDD)

- The _Unknown Dupe Discharge_ is introduced at [level 16](../level-16.mdx#the-unknown-dupe-discharge-udd).

### The 5 Number Discharge (5ND)

- The _5 Number Discharge_ is introduced in [level 19](../level-19.mdx#the-5-number-discharge-5nd).

### The Trash Push Discharge

- First, see the section on the [Trash Push](../level-14.mdx#the-trash-push).
- Normally, when known-trash is touched as the focus of the clue, and the known-trash is on chop, it communicates a _Trash Push_.
- However, what if the _Trash Pushed_ card is trash? The other players can see that this clue must have some other purpose - it should signal an _Discharge_ on the very next player.
- This move is extremely similar to the _Unknown Trash Discharge_. In UTD, the focus of the clue is promised as trash. In the _Trash Push Discharge_, the _Trash Pushed_ card is promised as trash.
