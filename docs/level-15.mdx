## Special Moves

### The Double Bluff

- Sometimes, Bob and Cathy will have playable cards on their _Finesse Position_. In this situation, you might be able to perform a _Double Finesse_ to get them to immediately blind-play. However, this is only possible if both cards are related, and the "connecting" card is available to _Play Clue_.
- In the same way that you can sometimes perform a _Bluff_ when a _Finesse_ is not available, you can also sometimes perform a _Double Bluff_ when a _Double Finesse_ is not available. This is performed by giving a _Play Clue_ to a non-trash card that is not a legal _Bluff_-target.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Red 1 is currently played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Donald red, which touches a red 4 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Since red 4 must be playable right now, Bob thinks he has the red 2 and the red 3. Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card, but it is actually a blue 1.
  - Cathy sees that Bob blind-played because of the red clue. However, the red 4 is a non-trash card and not a legal _Bluff_-target. Thus, Alice must intend for a _Double Bluff_ instead of a single _Bluff_. Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card and it is a yellow 1.
  - At first, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 2 (as a _Play Clue_).
  - After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 3 (as a _Bluff_).
  - After Cathy blind-played, Donald knows that his card was not a valid _Bluff_ target for the blue 1, and so he must have the red 4 (as a _Double Bluff_).
    - For players not yet at level 16, Donald would also mark the card as a potential red 5 in addition to a red 4.

<DoubleBluff />

- Similar to other kinds of _Bluffs_, _Double Bluffs_ may only be performed from _Bluff Seat_, and must be demonstrated immediately. In other words, both blind-plays must occur on the two turns directly following the clue.
- _Double Bluffs_ are valid even if the card which Bob blind-plays connects to the card which is clued by Alice.
  - For example, the previous scenario works equally well if Bob's blue 1 is replaced by a red 2.
  - In this situation, Cathy would not know whether the clue is a _Double Bluff_ or _Double Finesse_ until after she blind-plays.
  - This used to be called a _Double Half Bluff_, but this term was phased out because the distinction is not really relevant: Cathy does not care which situation she is in, as she is required to blind-play immediately either way.
- Some more-specific types of _Double Bluffs_ are listed below.

### The Triple Bluff (Illegal)

- We agree that all _Bluff_-style clues should resolve after two-blind plays.
- Thus, there is no such thing as a _Triple Bluff_.

### The Hard Double Bluff

- Similar to a _[Hard 3 Bluff](level-13.mdx#the-hard-3-bluff)_, it is also possible to perform a _Hard Double Bluff_.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - No cards are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Donald, touching a red 4 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob blind-plays red 1 from his _Finesse Position_.
  - Cathy blind-plays red 2 from her _Finesse Position_.
  - Even though red 1 and red 2 are the same suit as the red 4, the team knows that no-one is promised the red 3, since two blind-plays happened immediately after the clue.
  - Donald knows that his clued card can be any 4.

### The Pestilent Double Bluff (PDB)

- Normally, a _Double Bluff_ can only be initiated with a card that is not a legal _Bluff_-target. However, this is not always true.
- Sometimes, Alice can clue a legal _Bluff_-target to make Bob blind-play, and then "force" Cathy to blind-play as well in order to resynchronize the information about the identity of the clued card.
- This is called a _Pestilent Double Bluff_ to distinguish it from the more-normal _Double Bluff_ where a non-legal _Bluff_-target is used.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Donald, touching a red 2 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob blind-plays a blue 1 from his _Finesse Position_.
  - Cathy sees that right now, Donald will assume that he has the blue 2 (because it directly connects to the blue 1 that Bob blind-played). This is bad, because the card is really a red 2.
  - Cathy knows that because information is still not synchronized amongst the team, Alice must intend for Cathy to blind-play a card as a _Pestilent Double Bluff_.
  - Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_. It is a green 1 and it successfully plays.
  - At first, Donald thought that his 2 was either a blue 2 (as a _Finesse_ on Bob) or a green 2 (as a _Finesse_ on Cathy).
  - After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that his 2 was a blue 2 (as a _Finesse_ on Bob).
  - After Cathy blind-played, Donald knows that something weird happened. If his 2 really was blue 2, then Cathy would not have blind-played anything, so his 2 cannot be blue 2.
  - Donald knows that his 2 cannot be green 2 either, or else Bob would not have blind-played anything. (He would have waited for Cathy to blind-play.)
  - Thus, Donald marks his 2 as either red 2, yellow 2, or purple 2.

## General Principles

### Deferring a Bluff

- From _Urgency Principle_, we know that players are allowed to defer a _Finesse_ or a _Bluff_ in order to do a _Finesse_ or _Bluff_ of their own. And indeed, when players see a really good clue, they should probably defer blind-playing to give the clue. But there are limits.
- When a player knows for sure that they are _Finessed_ (instead of _Bluffed_), then deferring a _Finesse_ (to perform another _Finesse_ or _Bluff_) is great! It has almost no downsides, other than the obvious loss of _Tempo_. Everyone on the team is "in the know", so to speak.
- When a player _could_ be _Bluffed_, deferring a _Bluff_ can be extremely dangerous because it causes _Information Desynchronization_ throughout the team.
- Deferring a _Bluff_ to perform a _Finesse_ can be pretty clear, depending on the situation. It should be done sparingly.
  - Note that deferring a _Bluff_ to perform a _Finesse_ can potentially lose the game if the original cluer is performing a _Double Half Bluff_. So there is some risk involved.
- Deferring a _Bluff_ to perform **another** _Bluff_ is much worse. Since the _Bluff_ was not immediately resolved, the game state "fractures" into two valid game states for the receivers of each clue (e.g. the player who received the clue that initiated the first _Bluff_, and the player who received the clue that initiated the _Deferred Bluff_). This means that these two players will have to entertain two entire hypothetical game states in their mind and build upon each hypothetical with each new piece of information. This makes it extremely difficult for them to plan ahead or make correct decisions during their turns.
- Thus, deferring a _Bluff_ to do another _Bluff_ should **almost never be performed**.
- Also, see the below section on _Deferring a Double Bluff_.

### Deferring a Double Bluff

- First, see the section on _[Deferring a Bluff](#deferring-a-bluff)_.
- If Bob suspects that Alice is performing a _Double Bluff_, then Bob should **never defer**. It is very important that _Double Bluffs_ resolve immediately.
- Similarly, if Bob blind-plays, and Cathy can not rule out a _Double Bluff_, then Cathy should **never defer**. (If Cathy defers, it will cause an unrecoverable _Information Desynchronization_, because her future blind-play will not be interpreted as related to the _Double Bluff_.)

### A Table for Deferring Bluffs

| Alice is deferring a               | to perform a | Ok?                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Finesse                            | Finesse      | Yes!                     |
| Finesse                            | Bluff        | Yes!                     |
| Bluff                              | Finesse      | Sometimes, use sparingly |
| Bluff                              | Bluff        | Almost never do this     |
| Double Bluff (first blind-player)  | Finesse      | No, **never** do this    |
| Double Bluff (first blind-player)  | Bluff        | No, **never** do this    |
| Double Bluff (second blind-player) | Finesse      | No, **never** do this    |
| Double Bluff (second blind-player) | Bluff        | No, **never** do this    |

### Interaction between Bob's Truth Principle and Occam's Razor

- First, see the sections on _[Bob's Truth Principle](level-11.mdx#bobs-truth-principle-part-1)_ and _[Occam's Razor](level-11.mdx#clue-interpretation--occams-razor)_.
- Normally, Bob follows _Occam's Razor_ - he assumes that clues mean the thing with the least amount of blind-plays and _Prompts_.
- However, sometimes Bob can see that a clue is either a _Double Bluff_ or a _Finesse_, where the _Finesse_ needs more blind-plays than the _Bluff_.
- In this situation, even though the _Finesse_ requires more blind-plays, we agree that Bob should always assume the _Finesse_ interpretation because of _Bob's Truth Principle_.
- For example in a 3-player game:
  - On the first turn of the game, Alice clues number 4, touching Bob's slot 1 card as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob sees Cathy's _Finesse Position_ card is a playable red 1.
  - Thus, Bob knows that Alice's clue can either be:
    - a _Reverse Finesse_ on a red 4, meaning that Cathy will blind-play the red 1, and then Bob will blind-play the red 2 and the red 3
    - a _Double Bluff_, meaning that Bob will blind-play some playable card and then Cathy will blind-play the red 1
  - Bob knows that in this situation, _Bob's Truth Principle_ applies, so he knows it must be a _Reverse Finesse_ instead of a _Double Bluff_.
