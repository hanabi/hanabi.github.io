- These challenge questions are designed to test the understanding of each "level" of conventions. Often times, players learning the H-Group convention framework may want to have a more solid understanding of how each convention is used before trying it out in a real game.
- Challenge questions can help people understand how the conventions work, but they are no substitute for a healthy amount of practice. It takes many games with real people to master each level.
