- These challenge questions are designed to test players' understanding of each "level" of conventions outlined in the [strategy guide](learning-path). Often times, players learning the H-group convention set may want to have a more solid understanding of how each convention is used before trying it out in a real game.
- Challenge questions can only emulate how conventions might be used in a real game - it is still highly recommended to master these conventions through real game practice.
