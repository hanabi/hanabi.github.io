[Hanab Live](https://hanab.live) is programmed by enthusiasts who have played the game thousands of times. In order to keep the game fresh, the server allows you to create games using many different variants. The implemented variants are [described in a separate document](https://github.com/Hanabi-Live/hanabi-live/blob/main/docs/VARIANTS.md).

### Hard Variants & Easy Variants

- Some variants demand an enormous amount of efficiency. Since our normal conventions result in conservative play, we agree to change the way that we play in some specific variants in order to win more consistently.
- We define any variant that requires equal to or greater than 1.33 efficiency as a "hard" variant. (Required efficiency can be seen in-game using the Hanab Live interface. Note that a variant can be considered easy in 4-player, but hard in 5-player, for example.)
- Additionally, the following variants are considered to be hard variants even though they may have less than 1.33 required efficiency:
  - Color Mute
  - Number Mute
  - Cow & Pig
  - Duck
  - Throw It in a Hole
  - Up or Down

<br />

#### Convention Changes for All Hard Variants

- Players are not allowed to _Double Discard Avoid_.
  - Any clue given in a _Double Discard_ situation will instead be treated like a clue given in a non-_Double Discard_ situation.
- Players are not allowed to _5 Stall_ in the _Early Game_.
  - Any clue that looks like a _5 Stall_ is instead treated as either a _5's Chop Move_ or a _5 Pull_.
- Players are not required to clue anything in the _Early Game_; they are allowed to initiate the _Mid-Game_ whenever they see fit.
- Players are not allowed to give [_Double Tempo Clues_](level-6.mdx#the-valuable-tempo-clue).
  - If a _Tempo Clue_ is given that touches two or more cards, only the leftmost card is communicated to be playable.
  - This will therefore cause a [_Tempo Clue Chop Move_](level-6.mdx#the-tempo-clue-chop-move-tccm).
- _Loaded Play Clues_, as defined below, are turned on.

<br />

### The Early Save

- Normally, players are allowed to give a _Save Clue_ to a card on chop, even if that clued player:
  - has one or more playable cards to play (e.g. they won't discard their chop because they will almost certainly play their playable card)
  - has one or more known-trash cards to discard (e.g. they won't discard their chop because they will almost certainly discard their known-trash card instead)
- If a _Save Clue_ is given in this kind of situation, it is referred to as an _Early Save_. In our group, _Early Saves_ are normal, and they don't cause anything special to happen. (Allowing _Early Saves_ is nice because it allows for _Discard Modulation._)

<br />

### The Loaded Play Clue (in Hard Variants) (LPC)

- First, see the section on the _[Early Save](#the-early-save)_.
- In [_Hard_ variants](#hard-variants--easy-variants), _Early Saves_ are not legal. Instead, if an _Early Save_ is given to a player, then it is treated as a _Play Clue_ on that card.
- This is called a _Loaded Play Clue_ to distinguish it from a more ordinary _Play Clue_, because the player receiving the clue is currently "loaded" with a play or "loaded" with a safe discard.
- For example, in a 3-player game of a _Hard_ variant:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks. Blue 4 is in the trash.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching a 3 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob clues number 4 to Cathy, touching a 4 on chop. Is it a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_?
  - Cathy knows that normally, Bob's number 4 clue could be an _Early Save_ on a blue 4 (which is currently critical).
  - However, Cathy also knows that _Early Saves_ are turned off in _Hard_ variants. Since Cathy is loaded with her playable 3, Bob's clue must have been a _Loaded Play Clue_.
  - Cathy plays the 3. It is a red 3 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy now knows that her 4 must be the red 4 (connecting to the red 3).

#### Chop Moves

- As previously discussed, _Loaded Play Clues_ apply to _Early Saves_, which are a form of _Save Clue_.
- Subsequently, _Loaded Play Clues_ do not ever apply to _Chop Moves_, since _Chop Moves_ are a referential type of clue and do not belong in the category of moves called _Save Clues_.
- In other words, a _Chop Move_ is always a _Chop Move_, regardless of whether a player is _Loaded_ or not.

<br />

#### Exceptions

- _Loaded Play Clues_ **do not** apply in the _Early Game_ - they are only "turned on" in the _Mid-Game_.
- _Loaded Play Clues_ **do not** apply in _Double Discard_ situations. (Even though _Double Discard Avoidance_ is "turned off" in hard variants in general, players are still allowed to avoid _Double Discarding_ by giving _Early Saves_ to cards.)
- _Loaded Play Clues_ **do** apply in stalling situations (e.g. 8-clue stalling situations), but only if there are other things to do that are [equal or lower precedence](level-9.mdx#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table).
- _Loaded Play Clues_ **do not** apply to number 5 clues during the _Low Score Phase_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the _Low Score Phase_.
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a known red 4 in his hand on slot 5.
  - Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching a 5 on slot 3.
  - Bob knows that he is _Loaded_, because he has a red 4 to play. Bob knows that normally, no-one else is supposed to give _Save Clues_ to _Loaded_ players (and that they should be transformed into _Play Clues_).
  - However, Bob knows that this rule doesn't apply to number 5 clues during the _Low Score Phase_.
  - Thus, Bob marks his slot 4 card as being _Chop Moved_ and plays the red 4.

<LoadedException />

- For example, in a 3-player game (similar to the last example):
  - It is the _Low Score Phase_.
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a known red 4 in his hand on slot 4.
  - Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching a 5 on slot 5 (Bob's chop).
  - Bob knows that he is _Loaded_, because he has a red 4 to play. Bob knows that normally, no-one else is supposed to give _Save Clues_ to _Loaded_ players (and that they should be transformed into _Play Clues_).
  - However, Bob knows that this rule doesn't apply to number 5 clues during the _Low Score Phase_.
  - Thus, Bob knows that Alice is performing a simple _5 Save_ and plays the red 4.

### The Always Loaded Principle

- In certain variants, a specific type of clue always looks like a _Save Clue_ regardless of which cards are in the discard pile.
- For example:
  - In a dark prism variant, a 3 or 4 clue to the chop always looks like a _Save Clue_ on prism 3 or prism 4.
  - In a brown variant, a brown clue to the chop always looks like a _Save Clue_ on a brown 2, a brown 5, or another critical brown card.
- In such cases, we agree that this specific type of clue, if given to a player who is _Loaded_, must always be treated as a play clue. (This includes during the _Early Game_.)
- For example, in a 3-player game with a gray suit:
  - Gray 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is completely unclued.
  - Alice clues a gray 3 with a rank 3 clue on Cathy, who is currently _Loaded_.
  - Normally, Bob would assume that this is an _Early Save_. But due to the _Always Loaded Principle_, this must be a _Loaded Play Clue_.
  - Bob plays his _Finesse Position_ card. It is a gray 2 and it successfully plays.
- One consequence of this principle is that in some cases, you can use it to get cards played that do not belong to a special suit.
- For example, in a 3-player game with a gray suit:
  - Gray 2 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is completely unclued.
  - Alice clues a critical blue 3 with a rank 3 clue on Cathy, who is currently _Loaded_.
  - Normally, Bob would assume that this is an _Early Save_. But due to the _Always Loaded Principle_, this must be a _Loaded Play Clue_.
  - If Bob does nothing, Cathy will assume that it is a _Loaded Play Clue_ on the gray 3.
  - Thus, Bob plays his _Finesse Position_ card. It is a blue 2 and it successfully plays.

### The Ambiguous Tempo Clue

- In certain variants, there are different cards which are indistinguishable by clues, meaning that they respond to all the same number and color clues.
- The pink, light pink, omni, brown, and muddy rainbow variants all have their own conventions for dealing with this.
- If a player has two indistinguishable cards clued, it is hard to give a _Tempo Clue_ to the right-most card. Thus, we agree that:
  - a color _Tempo Clue_ should focus the right-most card.
  - a rank _Tempo Clue_ should focus the left most card.

<br />

### 2-Player

- In the _H-Group_, we generally only play games with 3 to 5 players. If you are interested in playing 2-player games, then see the [2-player page](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/2-player.md).

<br />

### Empty Clues

- _Empty Clues_ are clues that touch no cards in a hand. On Hanab Live, each game has the option to allow _Empty Clues_. In our group, we typically disallow this option since it makes the game too easy.
- If _Empty Clues_ are enabled, it allows for a much wider channel of information transfer. We have developed an entire convention framework around this channel and it is too complicated to cover in a single section here.
- If you are interested in learning about in the extended _Empty Clue_ conventions, they are documented [on a separate page](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/empty-clues.md).
