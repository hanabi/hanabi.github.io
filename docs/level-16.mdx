## Conventions

<br />

### Duplicitous Value Clue

- It’s possible to pick up one or more valuable cards by tricking Bob into unknowingly playing a _Duped_ card.
- We agree that as long as such a clue meets _Minimum Clue Value Principle_ (not counting the duplicated card itself), no further _Prompts_ or _Blind-Plays_ should be called for.
- Instead, the team can immediately understand that this was simply a _Duplicitous Value Clue_, since it resulted in one or more extra valuable cards being _Touched_ for safekeeping.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Blue 2 and Red 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice holds a known Red 3.
  - Alice clues 3 to Bob as a _Play Clue_, touching 2 cards.
  - Bob plays his focused 3, assuming it's Blue, but gasps in surprise when it's actually Red 3.
  - Although this was unexpected, the team sees that this was a _Duplicitous Value Clue_, since there is sufficient value in _Good Touching_ Bob's other 3.
  - Bob marks his other 3 as **any** 3; it is not promised to be playable, so no one assumes they should _Blind-Play_ or _Prompt_ from the clue.
- For _Duplicitous Value Clues_ that do **not** meet _MCVP_, see the [Dupe Tempo Clue Principle](#dupe-tempo-clue-principle) below.

<br />

### Duplicitous Blind-Play

- As with the _Duplicitous Value Clue_, it's also possible to give a valuable clue that results in a _Duped_ card being blind-played.
- Once again, as long as the clue meets _Minimum Clue Value Principle_, no further _Prompts_ or _Blind-Plays_ should be called for.
  - In the past such a blind-play would cause Bob to continue to dig as a true _Finesse_, but this is no longer true; we agree that the creative _Good Touching_ of the extra card(s) already provide sufficient justification for the clue.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Blue 2 and Red 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice holds a known Red 3.
  - Alice clues Blue to Donald, touching a Blue 4.
  - Bob _Blind-Plays_ his _First Finesse_; it's Red 3.
  - Although this was unexpected, the team sees that this was a _Duplicitous Blind-Play_, since there is sufficient value in _Good Touching_ Donald's Blue 4.
  - Therefore, the team understands that no further _Blind-Plays_ are called for.
- Note that _Duplicitous Blind-Plays_ can also be performed with certain _Ejections_, _Discharges_, etc.

<br />

### Dupe Tempo Clue Principle

- What if a _Duplicitous_ clue doesn’t newly touch any additional valuable cards, but provides useful _Fill-In_ information?
- If a filled-in card is revealed as playable, this should retroactively be treated as a _Tempo Clue_.
  - This may or may not therefore cause a single _Tempo Clue Chop Move_, following the same condition guidelines as normal _Tempo Clues_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All 1s are played on the stacks.
  - Cathy holds a known Red 2.
  - Bob holds a previously-touched Green 2, but its rank is not yet known.
  - Alice clues 2 to Bob, newly touching one card while filling in his Green 2.
  - Bob plays the newly touched 2, and is shocked that it's a _Duped_ Red 2.
  - Since no new valuable cards were touched, Bob knows to treat this as a _Dupe Tempo Clue_.
  - Since his Green 2 was _Promptable_, and Alice was not in a valid _Stalling_ situation, Bob treats this as a single _Tempo Clue Chop Move_.

## Special Moves

<br />

### The Assisted Trash Chop Move

- _Trash Chop Moves_ can be incredibly useful; but what if there’s no way for Alice to simply and cleanly clue **known** trash?
- One clever solution is to perform an _Assisted Trash Chop Move_: this is when a _Trash Bluff_ or (single-touch) _Unknown Trash Discharge_ gets a known _Dupe_ to blind-play.
- The ultimate goal of such a clue will be clear to the team: communicate a _Trash Chop Move_ on all cards to the right of the clued card(s).
- For an example of an _Assisted Trash Bluff_, in a 3-player game:
  - Blue 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice holds a known Yellow 1.
  - Cathy's hand is r5, g3, b1, y4, g4.
  - Alice clues 1 to Cathy, as a _Trash Bluff_.
  - Bob and Cathy gasp as Bob blind-plays Yellow 1.
  - Alice's intention becomes clear to everyone: she wanted to provide Cathy with safe _Known Trash_, and expects Cathy to _Trash Chop Move_ her two cards behind the b1.
- For an example of an _Assisted Trash Discharge_, in a 3-player game:
  - The situation is the same as above.
  - Alice clues blue to Cathy, as an _Unknown Trash Discharge_.
  - Bob and Cathy gasp as Bob plays Yellow 1 from _Third Finesse Position_.
  - Cathy evaluates. If Alice's clue had touched a secondary blue card, this would simply be a [Duplicitous Blind-Play](#duplicitous-blind-play).
  - But since Alice's clue only resulted in _Known Trash_ being touched, Alice must have intended a _Trash Chop Move_ on Cathy.

<br />

### The Time Travel Chop Move (Direct Form)

- If Alice performs a _Duplicitous Clue_ that doesn’t touch other good cards or provide immediate _Tempo Fill-In_ information, it must have been done for some other reason.
- After the _Dupe_ reveals itself, the clued player can interpret the clue as a _Trash CM_ on their own hand (as if it were _Time Traveled_ _Known Trash_, from the future).
- Thus, the clued player _Chop Moves_ all cards that were to the right of the clued dupe.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All 2s are played.
  - Cathy holds a known Purple 3.
  - Alice clues 3 to Bob, newly touching a single card.
  - Bob plays his 3 and gasps when he sees it's Purple 3.
  - Since this was effectively a 0-for-1, Alice must have chosen this line in order to give Bob _Known Trash_.
  - Therefore, the team can all tell that Alice performed a _Time Travel Chop Move_. Bob _Chop Moves_ all the cards that were behind his Purple 3.

<br />

### The Time Travel Chop Move (Blind-Play Form)

- What if Alice wishes to perform a _Time Travel Chop Move_ on Bob, but is unable to cleanly clue it directly by itself?
- In such a case, Alice can still attempt to force the dupe to blind-play. She must choose carefully, though, to ensure that the end result is truly 'bad' enough to result in a full _Time Travel Chop Move_!
- More specifically, such a blind-play must be sure to avoid the following conditions:
  - The clue can’t otherwise meet _Minimum Clue Value Principle_.
  - The clue can’t simply look like a normal [Assisted Trash CM](#the-assisted-trash-chop-move) on the clue receiver.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - All 1s are played. Donald has a known Blue 2.
  - Bob has a previously clued red card. Alice reclues it with a 3 clue, touching no other cards.
  - Bob blind-plays as a _Self-Bluff_, but is shocked when a Blue 2 is played.
  - Since this resulted in a 0-for-1 - and it wasn’t any sort of potential emergency - Bob understands that he should _Chop Move_ everything that was behind his Blue 2, as a _Time Travel Chop Move_.
- In advanced games, it's also possible to perform _Time Travel Chop Moves_ further away from slot 1, by using certain 0-for-1 advanced techniques (such as _Useless Clue Ejections_, _Bad TCCME_,_Trash Push UTD_, etc).
