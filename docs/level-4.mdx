## Conventions

### Chop Moves

- Normally, players discard their oldest (right-most) unclued card. However, sometimes a player can know that an unclued card is very important.
- A _Chop Move_ is a special kind of move that indicates to a player that the unclued card that is currently on their chop is very important.
- After the _Chop Move_, the player considers the card on their chop to be touched with an "invisible" clue. Thus, their chop will "move" to the next right-most unclued card.
- A _Chop Move_ is permanent, meaning that a _Chop Moved_ card should not be discarded for the remainder of the game.
- The three simplest kinds of _Chop Moves_ are listed below.
  (In levels 6 and 7, two additional common kinds of _Chop Moves_ will be introduced:
  _[Tempo Clue Chop Moves (TCCM)](level-6.mdx#the-tempo-clue-chop-move-tccm)_, and
  _[Scream Discard Chop Moves (SDCM)](level-7.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)_.)

## Special Moves

### The Trash Chop Move

- In the middle of a game, if all of the 1's have been played already, and someone clues a 1, this is quite strange. (From _Good Touch Principle_, players are not supposed to touch cards that have already been played.) In this situation, the 1 is considered to be _Trash_.
- The clue must have some deeper meaning. We agree that it means that the cards to the right of the trash are important. The point of the clue was to give the player a safe discard.
- However, in addition to giving a safe discard, it should also _Chop Move_ **all** of the cards to the right of the trash.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played.
  - Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice clues 1's to Bob, which touches a 1 in his slot 4.
  - Bob _Chop Moves_ his slot 5.
  - Bob discards the 1.
  - Bob's chop is now his slot 4.

<TrashChopMove1 />

- Most of the time, the _Trash Chop Move_ is done for a single card (meaning that the trash card that was clued was one-away from chop). However, you can also use the _Trash Chop Move_ to _Chop Move_ multiple cards.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 1's have been played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice clues 1's to Bob, which touches a 1 in his slot 1.
  - Bob _Chop Moves_ his slot 2, his slot 3, his slot 4, and his slot 5 (a quadruple _Chop Move_).
  - Bob discards the 1.
  - Bob's chop is now his slot 1.

<TrashChopMove2 />

- _Trash Chop Moves_ are most commonly performed with a number 1 clue because it is likely that in the middle of a game, all of the 1's will be already played. But it could also be done with a number two 2 clue if all the 2's are already played / accounted for. Or, it could be done with a red clue if all of the red cards are already played / accounted for. And so forth.
- Strategy wise, the _Trash Chop Move_ is used for two main reasons:
  1. Sometimes there are multiple critical cards in a row on chop and it falls to one player to save all of them. In this situation, a multiple-card _Chop Move_ could be the only way to do it.
  1. Some cards (e.g. a _one-away-from-playable_ 3) are quite useful to the team, but "illegal" to touch directly (as touching them directly with a clue would imply that they are playable right now). If the game is going well, then it can be useful to "waste" a clue in order to have the card saved permanently.
- Note that you are **not** allowed to _Trash Chop Move_ a card that you can just clue directly with a _Save Clue_ (unless there are multiple critical cards in a row on chop and you have no other choice). This is because having some positive information is always better than having the card be a mystery.
- If a _Trash Chop Move_ touches **multiple** trash cards, then it only _Chop Moves_ the cards to the right of the right-most trash card.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice clues 1's to Bob, which touches a 1 in slot 2 and a 1 in slot 4.
  - Bob **only** _Chop Moves_ his slot 5 card.

<TrashChopMove3 />

### The 5's Chop Move (5CM)

- Normally, we are only allowed to save 5's on chop (unless it is done with a _5 Stall_ clue, which can happen in the _Early Game_ and in other "stalling" situations).
- So, if a number 5 clue is performed on a 5 that is not on chop, and it is **not** a stalling situation, then it will normally look like a _Play Clue_ on that 5.
- However, if the 5 is:
  - **one-away** from chop (or, if two or more 5's are clued and the right-most 5 is one-away from chop), and
  - the chop card is not a trash card
- Then, we agree that it has a special meaning, and that the clue is **not** a _Play Clue_ at all.
- Instead, it is understood that the clue is a _5's Chop Move_, and the player should _Chop Move_ in a manner similar to the _Trash Chop Move_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice clues 5's to Bob, which touches a 5 on slot 4.
  - Bob _Chop Moves_ his slot 5 card. Bob's new chop is his slot 3.

<FivesChopMove1 />

- Similar to the _Trash Chop Move_, if a _5's Chop Move_ touches **multiple** 5's, then it only _Chop Moves_ the cards to the right of the right-most 5.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice clues 5's to Bob, which touches a 5 in slot 2 and a 5 in slot 4.
  - Bob **only** _Chop Moves_ his slot 5 card. Bob's new chop is his slot 3.

<FivesChopMove2 />

- Note that the _5's Chop Move_ is different than the _Trash Chop Move_ in that you can only chop move **one** card with it. Thus, if you clue a 5 and it is **two** (or more) slots away from the chop, then it is to be assumed to be a _Play Clue_ on the 5.
  - When counting how far away from chop a card is, you should only look at **unclued** cards.
- Remember that _5 Stalls_ takes precedence over _5's Chop Moves_. Thus, if a number 5 clue **could** just be a _5 Stall_ (e.g. it is the _Early Game_), then it should not _Chop Move_ anything.
  - Technically, one could try to analyze whether a clue is a _5 Stall_ or _5's Chop Move_ by looking at whether the clue-giver had a different clue to give, since _5 Stalls_ are only permitted if all "normal" _Play Clues_ and _Save Clues_ have been extinguished. However, this analysis relies on asymmetric information, and can be confusing even for experienced players. So, this move is not introduced until [level 19](level-19.mdx#special-moves).
- For level 19+ players, see the _[Early 5's Chop Move](level-19.mdx#the-early-5s-chop-move)_.
- For level 22+ players, there are [additional rules](level-22.mdx#interaction-with-5-rank-clues) relating to the _5's Chop Move_.

### The Order Chop Move (OCM)

- First, see the section on [Playing Multiple 1's](level-3.mdx#playing-multiple-1s).
- We agree that unknown 1's are supposed to be played in a particular order. If a player has unknown 1's and does **not** play them in the correct order, it means that they are trying to send an additional message.
- If a player skips over **one** of the 1's, and there is nothing else special going on, it means that the next player should _Chop Move_ one card.
- If a player skips over **two** of the 1s, the message skips over the next player, and the player after that should _Chop Move_ one card.
- A skip of **three** 1's means that the player three seats away should _Chop Move_, and so on.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Bob number 1, which touches three 1's. They are in slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  - Bob is expected to play slot 3 (which is the oldest 1). If he plays slot 3, nothing special happens.
  - If Bob plays slot 2, then he is skipping over one card. Cathy should _Chop Move_ one card (her slot 5).
  - If Bob plays slot 1, he is skipping over two cards. Alice should _Chop Move_ one card (her slot 5).

<OrderChopMove />

- If a player decides to do an _Order Chop Move_, on their next turn, they should revert to the original order again.
- For example, continuing from the previous example:
  - Bob decides to play slot 2, performing an _Order Chop Move_ on Cathy.
  - Cathy marks her slot 5 card as being _Chop Moved_. Then, Cathy gives an unrelated clue.
  - Alice gives an unrelated clue.
  - Now, Bob has two 1's left in slot 2 and slot 3.
  - Bob is expected to play slot 3 (which is the oldest 1). If he plays slot 3, nothing special happens.
  - If Bob plays slot 2, he is performing another _Order Chop Move_, and Cathy should _Chop Move_ one card. (It would be her slot 4, since her slot 5 is already _Chop Moved_.)
- There are some other common situations that do **not** imply an _Order Chop Move_. Use your common sense! Here is a short list:
  - The 1 that was played has a **different amount of positive clues** than the other 1's. (Different negative clues are ignored.)
  - The 1 that was played was originally _Finessed_ from a clue that happened **before** the number 1 clue.
  - The 1 that was skipped over is known to be bad from contextual information.
- The _Order Chop Move_ only applies to 1s. If it happens with any card that is not a 1, then it is never an _Order Chop Move_ and it just means nothing.

## General Principles

### Chop Moves as a Category

- As a matter of terminology, _Chop Moves_ do not count as _Save Clues_ - they exist in a separate category.
- This is because the _Chop Move_ is not a message about the touched card directly - it is a referential clue that talks about a different card.

### Chop Moves & New Clues

- Once a card has been _Chop Moved_ and is no longer in danger of being discarded, it is treated as an already-clued card with regards to new clues given to that hand.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 1's have been played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice clues 1's to Bob, which touches a 1 in his slot 4.
  - Bob _Chop Moves_ his slot 5.
  - Bob discards the 1.
  - Bob's chop is now his slot 4.
  - Cathy clues blue to Bob, which touches his slot 1 (the card he just drew) and his slot 5 (the card that was just _Chop Moved_).
  - Bob knows that the focus of the clue is always on the new card introduced, so this is **not** chop-focus, and the focus of the clue is on slot 1.
  - Thus, Bob will play blue 2 from slot 1 on his next turn.

<ChopMoveNew />

- The exception to the above rule is if a clue is given that touches a _Chop Moved_ card for the first time and only "old" cards are touched. In this case, the focus is on the left-most _Chop Moved_ card that was touched by the clue.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the rainbow variant:
  - All the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has an unknown red card on slot 3, an unknown red card on slot 4, and a _Chop Moved_ card in slot 5 (that is completely unclued).
  - Alice clues blue to Bob, which touches slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5. (Slot 3 and slot 4 are "filled in" to be rainbow cards and slot 5 is now a true blue card.)
  - Bob knows that the focus of the clue is normally on the new card introduced, but all three of the cards that were touched were "old".
  - Bob knows that when old cards are re-touched, the focus of the clue is the left-most of those cards.
  - However, Bob also knows that this is the exception to the rule. In this specific case, putting a positive clue on the _Chop Moved_ card was more important than filling in the rainbow cards, so by convention the focus of the clue is his slot 5.

<ChopMoveNewException />

### Chop Moves & Prompts

- _Chop Moves_ interact with _Prompts_ & _Finesses_ in a potentially confusing way. _Chop Moved_ cards should **not** be played into _Prompts_, even though they are imagined to have an "invisible" clue on them.
- For example:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has no cards clued in his hand, but he is _Chop Moved_ for a mystery card on his slot 5.
  - Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 3.
  - Bob knows that he is promised the red 2. If this is a _Finesse_, then he has the red 2 on his _Finesse Position_ (slot 1).
  - However, Bob is also _Chop Moved_ for a card. Bob knows that _Chop Moved_ cards have an "invisible" clue around them, and Bob also knows that _Prompts_ are said to take precedence over _Finesses_.
  - So should he play his slot 1 as a _Finesse_ or his slot 5 as a _Prompt_? In this situation, Bob knows that _Prompts_ do not apply to _Chop Moved_ cards, so Bob should play his slot 1.

<ChopMovePrompt />

## Common Mistakes

### Critical Discards after a Chop Move (Mistake)

- If a player _Chop Moves_ a card, and then the next time they discard, they discard a critical card, then obviously some kind of mistake occurred.
- The best explanation is that the _Chop Move_ was never intended in the first place.
- Thus, when this happens, the player should "undo" the _Chop Move_.

### Undoing an Accidental Chop Move (Mistake)

- Often times a player can misinterpret a clue as a _Chop Move_ when it really had some other meaning. If this happens, after they discard their new _Chop_, everyone else on the team will know that an accidental _Chop Move_ has occurred.
- Later on in the game, sometimes a player in this situation can retroactively realize that they have made a mistake by _Chop Moving_ earlier on. They might be tempted to shift their chop back to where it is supposed to be.
- However, unless they discard a critical card (see the above section), players should **not ever undo a _Chop Move_**, because they could be discarding a now-critical card that was not critical at the time of the original mistake. Everyone else on the team did not bother to clue the now-critical card, because they thought it was safely _Chop Moved_.
