title: Specific Conventions for White
---

These conventions apply to any variant with a white (touched by no colors) suit.

<br />

### The White Loaded Play Clue

- *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned on" for white cards.
- Normally, *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned off" in the *Early Game*. However, note that *Loaded Play Clues* **always** apply to white cards, even in the *Early Game*.
- This means that if a player is *Loaded*, and a *Chop-Focused* card *could* be white, then they will always assume that it is a *White Loaded Play Clue*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - White 2 is played on the stacks. Blue 3 is in the trash.
  - Bob has a globally-known playable red 1 in his hand.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a 3 on Bob's chop.
  - Normally, Bob would interpret this as an *Early Save* on the blue 3.
  - However, Bob knows that white 3 is currently playable and that he is *Loaded*. Thus, this must be a *White Loaded Play Clue* on a white 3.
- As an exception, *White Loaded Play Clues* do not apply to number 5 clues in the *Low Score Phase*.

### The White Loaded Self-Finesse

- Since players will always assume *White Loaded Play Clues*, you can also use them to perform *Self-Finesses*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - White 1 is played on the stacks. White 3 and blue 3 are in the trash.
  - Bob has a globally-known playable red 1 in his hand.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a 3 on Bob's chop.
  - Normally, Bob would interpret this as an *Early Save* on either the blue 3 or the white 3.
  - However, Bob knows that he is *Loaded* and that this 3 could be a white 3. Thus, this must be a *White Loaded Play Clue* on a white 3.
  - Bob does not see any white 2's, so he knows that he must have the white 2 as a *Self-Finesse*. Bob blind plays his *Finesse Position*. It is a white 2 and it successfully plays.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Cathy red, touching a red 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob clues Cathy number 2, touching a 2 on her chop.
  - Normally, Cathy would interpret this as an *Early 2 Save* on any 2 in the game.
  - However, Cathy knows that she is *Loaded* and that the 2 could be a white 2. Thus, this must be a *White Loaded Play Clue* on a white 2.
  - Bob does not see any white 1's, so he knows that he must have the white 1 as a *Self-Finesse*. Bob blind plays his *Finesse Position*. It is a white 1 and it successfully plays.
