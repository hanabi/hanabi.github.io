title: Specific Conventions for Prism
---

These conventions apply to any variant with a prism suit.

<br />

### Color Finesses (One-Away-From-Playable)

- For the purposes of *Finesses*, prism cards "match" if they are the direct next color.
- For example, in a 3-player game of *Prism (5 Suits)*:
  - Prism 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues green to Cathy, touching a prism 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays a prism 2 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy knows that since prism 3 is green, prism 2 matches green. Thus, this must be a *Finesse*.
  - Cathy plays her green as a prism 3.

### Color Bluffs (Two-Away-From-Playable)

- Players can perform a *Bluff* on a prism card with a color, as long as the focus of the clue is a valid *Bluff*-target and the color represents a prism card that is *two-or-more-away-from-playable*.
- As a consequence of this, you can *Bluff* a prism 1 by cluing a prism 3 (with color).
- For example, in a 3-player game of *Prism (5 Suits)*:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues green to Cathy, touching a prism 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays a prism 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy knows that prism 1 would match yellow, but it does not match green. Thus, this is just a *Bluff*.
  - Cathy marks her green card as either a green 2 (as a normal *Bluff*, a green 3 (as a *3 Bluff*), or a prism 3 (as a *Hard 3 Bluff*).
