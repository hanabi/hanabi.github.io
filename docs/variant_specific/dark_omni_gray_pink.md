title: Specific Conventions for Dark Omni & Gray Pink
---

These conventions apply to any variant with a dark omni suit or a gray pink suit.

<br />

### Inheritance

- Dark omni cards "inherit" all of the conventions for black cards and all of the conventions for omni cards.
- Gray pink cards "inherit" all of the conventions for black cards and all of the conventions for light pink cards.
- Some specific clarifications and exceptions are listed below.

### Normal Saves

- Dark omni or gray pink 2's on chop should be saved with a number 2 clue, as per normal.
- Dark omni or gray pink 5's on chop should be saved with a number 5 clue, as per normal.
- However, there are some exceptions, which are listed below.

### Pseudo 5 Saves

- Dark omni or gray pink 3's and 4's on chop should be saved with number 5 clue.
  - This is because we want to preserve the ability to give a *Play Clue* with number 3 or number 4.
- However, there are some exceptions, which are listed below.

### Fake Saves

- When saving a dark omni or gray pink card with a rank clue, players can break the rules listed above in order to:
  - avoid violating *Good Touch Principle*
  - pick up an extra card (as a 2-for-1 instead of a 1-for-1)
- *Pink Promise* does not apply if one of these things could be the case.
- Thus:
  - A 2 clue on chop (touching 1 card) --> `o2, any normal 2`
  - A 2 clue on chop (touching 2+ cards) --> `o2, o3, o4, o5, any normal 2`
  - A 3 clue on chop (touching X cards with no 3's in the trash) --> `any playable 3` (e.g. this is a *Play Clue*)
  - A 3 clue on chop (touching 1 card with 3's in the trash) --> `any 3 that is in the trash`
  - A 3 clue on chop (touching 2+ card with 3's in the trash) --> `o2, o3, o4, o5, any 3 that is in the trash`
  - A 4 clue on chop (touching X cards with no 4's in the trash) --> `any playable 4` (e.g. this is a *Play Clue*)
  - A 4 clue on chop (touching 1 card with 4's in the trash) --> `any 4 that is in the trash`
  - A 4 clue on chop (touching 2+ card with 4's in the trash) --> `o2, o3, o4, o5, any 4 that is in the trash`
  - A 5 clue on chop (touching X cards) --> `o2, o3, o4, o5, any other 5`
