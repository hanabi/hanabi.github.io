These conventions apply to any variant with a white suit (i.e. touched by no colors).

### The Loaded Play Clue Assumption

- Since it can be hard to get white cards on chop to play, the [_Always Loaded Principle_](../variant-specific.mdx#the-always-loaded-principle-alp) applies to save clues given with number 3 and number 4.
  - The _Always Loaded Principle_ never applies to number 2 clues or number 5 clues.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - White 2 and red 2 are played on the stacks. Blue 3 is in the trash.
  - Bob has a globally known playable green 1 in his hand.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a 3 on Bob's chop.
  - Normally, Bob would interpret this as an _Early Save_ on the blue 3.
  - However, Bob knows that white 3 is currently playable and that he is _Loaded_. Thus, this must be a _Play Clue_ on either a white 3 or a red 3.
