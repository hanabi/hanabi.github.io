These conventions apply to any variant with a gray (colorless and one-of-each) suit.

<br />

### White Conventions

- All white conventions also apply to gray cards.

### Gray 2 and Gray 5 Saves

- Just like any other suit, players should use the *2 Save* convention and the *5 Save* convention to save the gray 2 and the gray 5.

### Gray 3 and Gray 4 Saves

- Obviously, players must use number 3 and number 4 to save the gray 3 and the gray 4, respectively.
- Thus, players have to remember that any number 3 or number 4 clue to their chop could be a save on the gray 3 or the gray 4.
- Additionally, according to the *Always Loaded Principle*, save clues with number 3 or number 4 are always *Loaded*.
