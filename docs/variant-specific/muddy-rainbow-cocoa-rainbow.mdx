title: Muddy Rainbow & Cocoa Rainbow
---

These conventions apply to any variant with a muddy rainbow suit (touched by every color clue and none of the rank clues) or a cocoa rainbow suit (touched by every color clue and none of the rank clues, with every card unique).

<br />

### Inherited Conventions

- By default, muddy rainbow cards inherit all of the [rainbow
  conventions](rainbow.mdx) and all of the [brown conventions](brown.mdx).
  - With that said, some of the conventions further down on this page will overwrite some rainbow/brown conventions, so read on.
- Similarly, by default, cocoa rainbow cards inherit all of the [rainbow
  conventions](rainbow.mdx), all of the [brown conventions](brown.mdx), and all
  of the [black conventions](black.mdx).

### Tempo Clues

- Similar to brown cards, if a player gives a _Tempo Clue_ to a single muddy rainbow or cocoa rainbow card, it is never a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_. If a player gives a _Tempo Clue_ that touches multiple muddy rainbow or cocoa rainbow cards, it means only that the right-most muddy rainbow or cocoa rainbow card is playable.
- This is because it is fairly valuable to get muddy rainbow and cocoa rainbow cards out of the hand as soon as possible in case blocking cards are drawn.

### Muddy Rainbow Saves

- Since muddy rainbow 2 cannot be _2 Saved_ and muddy rainbow 5 cannot be _5 Saved_, there needs to be a separate way to save these cards.
- Any red color clue (the left-most color) to a chop card is treated as a potential _Muddy Rainbow Save_ on a muddy rainbow 2 or a muddy rainbow 5.
- Critical muddy rainbow 2s, 3s, and 4s can be saved with any color clue.
- Similar to brown saves, the _Always Loaded Principle_ applies to muddy rainbow saves.
- In the special case of a variant where a one-of-each-card color is available, the one-of-each-card color should be used instead of red.

### Cocoa Rainbow Saves

- Cocoa rainbow cards are always saved with red, the left-most color.
- In the special case of a variant where a one-of-each-card color is available, the one-of-each-card color should be used instead of red.

### Mud Clues

- In variants with a pink suit, the _[Pink Choice Tempo Clue](pink.mdx#the-pink-choice-tempo-clue)_ convention is "turned on", since players often have a _Free Choice_ with how they can clue pink cards. Muddy rainbow and cocoa rainbow have a similar convention called a _Mud Clue_.
- When one or more muddy rainbow or cocoa rainbow cards are retouched with a color clue, and there are no "new" cards introduced (or, if the only "new" cards introduced are trash), then extra information can be conveyed by what color is chosen. The color chosen should correspond to the slot that they should play.
- This is called a _Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clue_, or just a _Mud Clue_ for short.
- The position of the muddy rainbow or cocoa rainbow card, counted **from oldest to newest**, corresponds to the ordering of the colors **from right to left**, skipping the cards that are not touched by the color clue (and the known unplayable cards). Furthermore, colors always "wrap around" to the oldest card.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Muddy Rainbow (6 Suits)" variant:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has two muddy rainbow cards clued in his hand on slot 3 and slot 4. He does not know the rank of either card.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which re-touches both muddy rainbow cards and nothing else.
  - Bob knows that this must be a _Tempo Clue_ on the muddy rainbow cards, so now he must figure out which slot Alice wants him to play. To start with, Bob knows that the colors available to clue in this variant are red, yellow, green, blue, and purple.
  - Starting from the final color, a purple clue would mean to play slot 4, a blue clue would mean to play slot 3, a green clue would mean to play slot 4 (wraparound), a yellow clue would mean to play slot 3, and a red clue would mean to play slot 4 (another wraparound).
  - Bob plays his slot 4 card as a muddy rainbow 3. It successfully plays on the stacks.
- _Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clues_ are only allowed to get muddy or cocoa rainbow cards.
  - An exception to this rule can be made for extremely difficult variants. If the team needs to get a non-muddy card for some specific purpose (e.g. to "unlock" another player), and there was not another good way to "get" the card, then it should be clear to everyone what is happening.

### Mud Clues (Skipping Over Unplayable Cards)

- If known-unplayable cards are touched as part of a _Mud Clue_, then they should be skipped over.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Muddy Rainbow (6 Suits)" variant:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has two muddy rainbow cards clued in his hand on slot 2 and slot 4. He does not know the rank of either card. He also has a red 5 on slot 3 with a 5 clue on it.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which re-touches both muddy rainbow cards and the red 5.
  - Bob knows that this must be a _Tempo Clue_ on the muddy rainbow cards, so now he must figure out which slot Alice wants him to play. To start with, Bob knows that the colors available to clue in this variant are red, yellow, green, blue, and purple.
  - Starting from the final color, a purple clue would mean to play slot 4.
  - A blue clue would normally mean to play slot 3, but the red 5 is a known unplayable card, so Bob skips over that. Thus, a blue clue would mean to play slot 2.
  - A green clue would mean to play slot 4 (wraparound).
  - A yellow clue would mean to play slot 2 (skipping over the red 5 again).
  - A red clue would mean to play slot 4 (another wraparound).
  - Bob plays slot 4 as the muddy rainbow 3.

### Positional Clues

- Any clue that looks like one of the following is instead considered to be a _Muddy Positional Clue_ (that promises the slot number of the muddy rainbow card to play):
  - _Double Play Ejection_ (re-cluing a playable card)
  - _Known-Trash Ejection_ (re-cluing a known-trash card)
  - _Trash Pushes_ (cluing a known-trash card on chop for the first time)
  - a rank clue that has no conventional interpretation
- Note that _Trash Chop Moves_ are still "turned on".
