These conventions apply to variants with **both** a rainbow and a muddy rainbow suit.

### Muddy Rainbow Assumption

- If players get a color _Tempo Clue_ on two or more cards that could be either rainbow cards or muddy rainbow cards, this puts them in a conundrum:
  - If they are rainbow cards, then they should play the left-most touched card as a normal _Tempo Clue_.
  - If they are muddy rainbow cards, then they should play the one corresponding to the _Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clue_.
- In this situation, players always assume that they are muddy rainbow cards, and calculate which slot to play based on the color.
