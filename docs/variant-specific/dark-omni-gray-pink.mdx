title: Dark Omni & Gray Pink
---

These conventions apply to any variant with a dark omni suit or a gray pink suit.

<br />

### Inheritance

- Dark omni cards "inherit" all of the conventions from the base suits (e.g. [dark pink conventions](dark-pink.mdx), [black conventions](black.mdx), [omni conventions](omni.mdx)).
- Gray pink cards "inherit" all of the conventions from the base suits (e.g. [dark pink conventions](dark-pink.mdx), [light pink conventions](light-pink.mdx)).
- Some specific clarifications and exceptions are listed below.

### Normal Saves

- Dark omni or gray pink 2's on chop should be saved with a number 2 clue, as per normal.
- Dark omni or gray pink 5's on chop should be saved with a number 5 clue, as per normal.
- However, there are some exceptions, which are listed below.

### Pseudo 5 Saves

- Dark omni or gray pink 3's and 4's on chop should be saved with number 5 clue.
  - This is because we want to preserve the ability to give a _Play Clue_ with number 3 or number 4.
- However, there are some exceptions, which are listed below.

### Fake Saves

- When saving a dark omni or gray pink card with a rank clue, players can break the rules listed above in order to:
  - avoid violating _Good Touch Principle_
  - pick up an extra card (as a 2-for-1 instead of a 1-for-1)
- _Pink Promise_ does not apply if one of these things could be the case.
- Thus:
  - A 2 clue on chop (touching 1 card) --> `o2, any normal 2`
  - A 2 clue on chop (touching 2+ cards) --> `o2, o3, o4, o5, any normal 2`
  - A 3 clue on chop (touching X cards with no 3's in the trash) --> `any playable 3` (e.g. this is a _Play Clue_)
  - A 3 clue on chop (touching 1 card with 3's in the trash) --> `any 3 that is in the trash`
  - A 3 clue on chop (touching 2+ card with 3's in the trash) --> `o2, o3, o4, o5, any 3 that is in the trash`
  - A 4 clue on chop (touching X cards with no 4's in the trash) --> `any playable 4` (e.g. this is a _Play Clue_)
  - A 4 clue on chop (touching 1 card with 4's in the trash) --> `any 4 that is in the trash`
  - A 4 clue on chop (touching 2+ card with 4's in the trash) --> `o2, o3, o4, o5, any 4 that is in the trash`
  - A 5 clue on chop (touching X cards) --> `o2, o3, o4, o5, any other 5`

### The Fake 5's Chop Move & The Fake 5 Pull & The Fake 5 Number Ejection & The Fake 5 Number Discharge

- First, see the section on the _[Fake 5's Chop Move](dark-pink.mdx#the-fake-5s-chop-move)_ & the _[Fake 5 Pull](dark-pink.mdx#the-fake-5-pull--the-fake-5-number-ejection--the-fake-5-number-discharge)_ (in variants with a dark pink suit).
- Just like with dark pink, players can perform _Fake 5's Chop Moves_, _Fake 5 Pulls_, _Fake 5 Number Ejections_ and _Fake 5 Number Discharges_ in variants with a dark omni or gray pink suit.
