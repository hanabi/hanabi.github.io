These conventions apply to any variant with an omni (touched by all clues) suit.

<br />

### Pink Conventions

- All [pink conventions](pink.mdx) also apply to omni cards.

### Soft Good Touch Principle

- Sometimes, players can play cards "automatically" from _Good Touch Principle_.
- For example, if the blue 4 and the omni 5 are played on the stacks, then a remaining blue card would be a known blue 5, and would be automatically played without any additional clues being given.
- However, due to the nature of omni cards, it is common for clues to "pick up" trash omni cards.
- Thus, players should **not** automatically play cards from _Good Touch Principle_ in this manner.
- However, players should still play clued cards if they could be part of a _Prompt_.
- For example:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a card marked in his has with a number 1 clue.
  - From _Good Touch Principle_, Bob knows that the card as either omni 2, omni 3, omni 4, or omni 5.
  - Alice gives a _Play Clue_ to an omni 3 in Cathy's hand.
  - Bob knows that he is _Prompted_ for the omni 2. He plays the number 1 card (as opposed to blind-playing slot 1 as a _Finesse_).

### Trash Pushes in Omni

- When a _Trash Push_ happens in a normal variant, if more than one card is touched, then all of the touched cards are known to be trash.
- When a _Trash Push_ happens in a variant with an omni suit, if more than one card is touched, it is possible that only the card on chop was trash, and that the other cards touched are useful / critical omni cards.
- In this situation, after blind-playing the _Trash Pushed_ card, the player should first discard the card that initiated the _Trash Push_ (the oldest card) and then hold on to the other touched cards.
  - In this situation, _Good Touch Principle_ applies to the other touched cards. The other members of the team must give a _Fix Clue_ to those cards if they are also trash.

### Mud Clues

- When one or more omni cards are retouched with a color clue, and there are no "new" cards introduced (or, if the only "new" cards introduced are trash), then extra information can be conveyed by what color is chosen. The color chosen should correspond to the slot that they should play.
- This is called a _Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clue_, or just a _Mud Clue_ for short.
- The position of the omni card, counted **from oldest to newest**, corresponds to the ordering of the colors **from right to left**, skipping the cards that are not touched by the color clue (and the known unplayable cards). Furthermore, colors always "wrap around" to the oldest card.
- _Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clues_ may not get single-colored cards.
  - An exception to this rule can be made for extremely difficult variants. If the team needs to get a single-colored card for some specific purpose (e.g. to "unlock" another player), and there was not another good way to "get" the card, then it should be clear to everyone what is happening.

### Mud Clues (Skipping Over Unplayable Cards)

- If known-unplayable cards are touched as part of a _Mud Clue_, then they should be skipped over.
