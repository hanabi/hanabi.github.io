These conventions apply to variants with rainbow-ones or rainbow-fives.

<br />

### Color Promise

- When giving a color clue to a rainbow-one or a rainbow-five, you are expected to use the color that matches the card.
- There are some exceptions, which are listed below.

### The Color Play Clue Lie

- First, see the section on the *[Pink Play Clue Lie](pink.md#the-pink-play-clue-lie-ppcl-with-a-mismatched-play-clue-that-touches-other-cards)* (for pink variants).
- Similar to how the *Pink Play Clue Lie* violates *Pink Promise*, you can do a *Color Play Clue Lie* to violate *Color Promise* in the same way.
- In other words, you can break *Color Promise* if:
  - using a "wrong" color would get extra cards (e.g. a 2-for-1 instead of a 1-for-1)
  - the card would play immediately or very soon
  - no-one else would be confused
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - The variant is "Rainbow-Ones (6 Suits)".
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, touching a blue 1 on slot 1 and a red 3 on slot 2.
  - Bob assumes that it is red 1 and plays it. It is instead the blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Bob reasons that Alice lied about the color identity of the 1 so that she could "get" the card on his slot 2 "for free".

### The Color Promise Finesse

- First, see the section on the *[Color Play Clue Lie](#the-color-play-clue-lie)*.
- Usually, when *Color Promise* is violated, it is a *Color Play Clue Lie*. But what if *Color Promise* is violated and the clue is only a 1-for-1? The clue giver must be trying to communicate something extra.
- In this situation, the next player should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card as a *Color Promise Finesse*.
- For example, in 3-player game:
  - The variant is "Rainbow-Ones (6 Suits)".
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a blue 1 on slot 1.
  - Bob sees that Cathy's hand has no other blue cards in it, so there is no good reason why Alice could not have just clued blue to Cathy and satisfied *Color Promise*. Alice must be trying to communicate something extra.
  - Bob knows that this is a *Color Promise Finesse* and blind-plays his finesse position. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that Alice performed a *Finesse* and that Cathy must have the red 2 that connects to the red 1 that was blind-played.
  - Cathy plays the red card and it is blue 1. It successfully plays.
  - Cathy now knows that Alice performed a *Color Promise Finesse* instead of a normal *Finesse*.
- Note that the *Color Promise Finesse* can only be performed if the card that is blind-played connects to the clue that was given. Otherwise, Cathy will think that a *Bluff* happened and will not play the clued card.

### The Color Prompt Exception (for Rainbow-Ones)

- First, see the section on the *[Pink Prompt Rank Exception](pink.md#the-pink-prompt-rank-exception)* (for pink variants).
- Similar to how there is a *Pink Prompt Rank Exception* for pink cards, there is also a *Color Prompt Exception* for rainbow-ones.
- In other words, cards in a player's hand that are clued with a single color clue are not treated to be a potential 1.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Bob's slot 2 card has a blue clue on it (and no other positive or negative clues).
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 2 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob knows that if the green card in his hand is red 1, then this would be a *Prompt*.
  - Bob knows that if the green card in his hand is not red 1, then this would be a *Finesse*.
  - Bob knows that normally, *Prompts* are supposed to take precedence over *Finesses*. However, in this case, since his green card only has a single color clue on it, the *Color Prompt Exception* applies, so he should assume a finesse.
  - Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
