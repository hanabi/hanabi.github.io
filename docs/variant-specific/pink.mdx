## Level 9 - Basic Pink Principles

### Pink Promise

- When a pink card is focused by a rank clue, the number must match the true identity of the card. In other words, the focused card is _Promised_ to match the number of the rank clue.
- _Pink Promise_ applies to all clues: _Play Clues_, _Save Clues_, _5 Stalls_, etc.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Cathy has a pink 2 on chop followed by a blue 5.
  - Alice and Bob need to give a _Save Clue_ to both the pink 2 and the blue 5.
  - If Alice gave a number 5 clue, it would save both of the cards in one fell swoop, since a number 5 clue would touch the pink 2.
  - However, doing that would break _Pink Promise_, since once Cathy learns that her slot 5 card is a pink card, she will always assume that it is a pink 5.
  - Thus, Alice gives a number 2 clue as a _2 Save_ on the pink 2, and then Bob clues a number 5 clue as a _5 Save_ on the blue 5.

<Promise />

- _Pink Promise_ is the **most important** pink convention! If you need to handle a tricky situation with pink cards, then make sure you first satisfy _Pink Promise_ so that it is clear to the team what is going on.

### The 1's Assumption

- Just like in a normal game, when a player gets clued about two or more 1's, then they should play all of them in the normal order.
- In other words, even though the non-focused 1's _could_ be non-1 pink cards, players are expected to _assume_ that they are real 1's.
- This assumption does **not** apply to the other ranks. For example, if all the 1's are played on the stacks, and a player has a card in their hand with a single positive number 2 clue on it, then they cannot play the 2, because they might be misplaying a pink 5.

### No Order Chop Moves

- Even though we have the _1's Assumption_ convention, it is still possible that a player will give a number 1 clue that touches a bunch of 1's and an unplayable pink card.
- In this situation, a _Fix Clue_ will need to be given in the future. (_Pink Fix Clues_ are covered later on.) But the first card that will be played from the clue will always be a real 1.
- Thus, in pink variants, players are not allowed to perform an _Order Chop Move_, because they could be misplaying a pink card.

### Good Touch Principle

- Due to the nature of pink cards being touched by a lot of different kinds of clues, they are a bit easier to duplicate than a normal suit, or even a rainbow suit.
- However, just like any other suit, _Good Touch Principle_ still applies to pink cards. Players should:
  - do their best to not duplicate pink cards
  - assume by default that the remaining pink cards in their hand are "good"

### Prompts with Pink Promise

- The _Pink Promise_ convention does **not** change how _Prompts_ work - players are still expected to play the left-most card into a _Prompt_ (or a _Priority Prompt_), just like they would in any other variant.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 2, slot, 3 and slot 5. This must be a _2 Save_.
  - Bob marks his slot 5 card as a true 2, because of _Pink Promise_. The cards on slot 2 and slot 3 could be 2's, but are not necessarily 2's.
  - Later on, Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 3 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that he is _Prompted_ for the red 2. Bob has three cards in his hand marked with a number 2 clue. Even though Bob knows for sure that slot 5 is a 2, Bob knows that the _Prompt_ simply calls for the left-most card.
  - Bob plays the red 2 from slot 2.

<PromisePrompt />

### The Pink Prompt Rank Exception

- Normally, _Prompts_ take precedence over _Finesses_. This means that if a card in a player's hand has one or more positive clues on it that "match", they should never blind-play their _Finesse Position_ and instead play their left-most clued card.
- This rule does **not** apply to potential pink cards that only have a single rank clue on them (and the rank on them does not match the rank of the promised card). In this situation, players should prefer playing their _Finesse Position_ instead of playing the clued card.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues pink to Cathy, touching a pink 4 on slot 1 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that this is either a _Prompt_ or a _Finesse_ on the pink 3.
  - Bob's slot 2 card and slot 3 card have a single number 4 clue of them (and no other clues). Thus, the pink 3 could technically be Bob's slot 2 card.
  - Bob knows that _Prompts_ normally take precedence over _Finesses_. However, Bob also knows that _Prompts_ do not apply to pink cards with a rank mismatch. This is currently the case for him since he is promised a 3 and his clued card has a number 4 clue on it.
  - Thus, Bob plays his _Finesse Position_ card as pink 3.

<PromptRankException />

- This rule applies to both _Prompts_ initiated by clues and _Prompts_ initiated by discarding a card (i.e. _Sarcastic Discards_).

<br />

### Remaining 1's After All the 1's Have Been Played

- Often times, in the beginning of the game, a player will receives a number 1 clue that touches a bunch of 1's. In these situations, they will play them all from oldest to newest (using the _1's Assumption_).
- If all of the 1's have been successfully played on the stacks and a player _still_ has 1's remaining in their hand, they should mark them as useful pink cards and hold on to them for later.
  - In other words, they should **not** assume that that they have the next playable pink card (e.g. pink 2).
- Later on, if a pink card is _Prompted_ from their hand, the player should play the 1.
  - In other words, the _Pink Prompt Rank Exception_ does not apply to these cards, because they are considered to be "filled-in" as a pink card.
- This same concept applies to remaining 2's after all of the 2's have been played, and so forth.

<br />

## Level 10 - Violations of _Pink Promise_ That Don't Require a Fix

### The Pink Play Clue Lie (PPCL) (With Multiple 1's)

- Players can violate _Pink Promise_ with a number 1's clue if all of the cards will successfully play.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching a red 1 on slot 1, a pink 3 on slot 2, a pink 2 on slot 3, and a pink 1 on slot 4.
  - Bob knows that from _Good Touch Principle_ and the _1's Assumption_ that all of his 1's are good, so he can play all of them from oldest to newest.
  - Bob plays the pink 1 from slot 4.
  - On his next turn, Bob plays the pink 2 from slot 3. Bob is immediately surprised that this is not a real 1, but he knows that this kind of thing is allowed and that he should continue to play his remaining 1's.
  - On his next turn, Bob plays the pink 3 from slot 2. Bob is again surprised that this is not a real 1, but he knows that this kind of thing is allowed and that he should continue to play his final 1.
  - On his next turn, Bob plays the red 1 from slot 1.

<PlayClueLie1s />

### The Pink Play Clue Lie (PPCL) (With a Mismatched _Play Clue_ That Touches Other Cards)

- Players can also violate _Pink Promise_ if they are giving a _Play Clue_ and the lie will be resolved when the player who is clued plays their focused card.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Pink 3 and red 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching a pink 4 on slot 1 and a blue 3 on slot 2.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy plays the card on slot 1, thinking that it is a red 3. It is actually the pink 4.
  - Cathy knows that Alice broke _Pink Promise_ and that she was lied to, but that it was a _Pink Play Clue Lie_. Cathy knows that Alice likely did things this way because she wanted a 2-for-1 (to pick up some useful 3 "for free") instead of just a 1-for-1 on just the pink 4.

<PlayClueLieMismatch />

<br />

## Level 11 - Pink Fix Clues

### The Pink Fix Clue (on 1's)

- Normally, when someone receives a number 1 clue that touches a bunch of 1's, they will play all of those 1's from oldest to newest.
- If a subsequent clue "fills in" one of the 1s to be a pink card, then the player will **not** play that card anymore (because it could just be any pink card in the game).
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching three 1's in slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  - Bob plays slot 3 and it is a red 1.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Alice discards.
  - Bob plays slot 2, and it is a blue 1.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching a 5 on his chop as a _5 Save_. This also "fills in" the 1 to be a pink card.
  - Bob knows that the pink card in his hand _could_ be a pink 1. However, it could also be any other pink card in the game. Bob knows that when 1's are filled in to be pink, they should not be played anymore.
- _Pink Fix Clues_ do not necessarily have to be performed "just in time". In other words, **any** rank clue that "fills in" a pink card should stop it from being played, even if the clue was early.

<FixClue1s />

### The Pink Fix Promise (PFP)

- First, see the section on the _[Pink Fix Clue (on 1's)](#the-pink-fix-clue-on-1s)_
- Normally, _Pink Promise_ only applies when a pink card is the focus of a clue. However, as an exception, _Pink Promise_ also applies to a _Pink Fix Clue_ that stops a card marked with a number 1 clue from misplaying.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching three 1's in slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  - Bob plays slot 3 and it is a red 1.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Alice discards.
  - Bob plays slot 2, and it is a blue 1.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a 3 on his chop. This also "fills in" the 1 to be a pink card.
  - Bob knows that the pink card in his hand could technically be a pink 1. However, Bob also knows that when 1's are filled in to be pink, they should not be played anymore.
  - Thus, Bob knows that the point of Alice's clue was a _Fix Clue_ to stop him from playing the pink card. The 3 on his chop could be any 3 in the game. Furthermore, Bob knows that _Pink Promise_ applies to this _Fix Clue_ and that his pink card should be a pink 3.

<FixPromise />

- As an exception, _Pink Fix Promise_ does **not** apply when the _Fix Clue_ is a number 2 clue or a number 5 clue and the newly introduced card was on chop. An example of this can be found in the [previous section](#the-pink-fix-clue-on-1s). (In the example in this section, Bob's pink card is not necessarily a pink 5; it could be any pink card in the game.)

### Pink Fix Clues (in general)

- Normally, if a clue re-touches pink cards that are known to be pink, it is treated as a _Pink Choice Tempo Clue_ or a _Pink Choice Finesse_.
- However, what if the indicated slot is not a pink card? That does not make sense, as _Pink Choice_ is typically only used to communicate a play about a pink card.
- In this situation, it must not be a _Play Clue_ at all. Instead, it is a _Fix Clue_ - the rank of the left-most pink card must match the clue.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 3's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a known pink card on slot 4 and a known pink card on slot 5.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, which re-touches the pink cards on slots 4 and 5.
  - Normally, Bob would interpret this as a _Pink Choice Tempo Clue_ and play his slot 3 card. However, his slot 3 card is completely unclued.
  - Bob instead knows that this must be a _Pink Fix Clue_ and that his left-most pink card (on slot 4) must be exactly the pink 3.
  - Bob discards his slot 4 card as pink 3.

<FixClue />

<br />

## Level 13 - Positional Moves

### Pink Tempo Clues

- If a player gives a _Tempo Clue_ to a single pink card, it is never a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_.
- This is because it is fairly valuable to get pink cards out of the hand as soon as possible in case blocking cards are drawn.

### The Pink Choice Tempo Clue

- When one or more pink cards are retouched with a pink clue, the interpretation should be as normal: play the cards from left to right as a _Tempo Clue_ (or a _Double Tempo Clue_).
- When one or more pink cards are retouched with a rank clue, and there are no "new" cards introduced (or, if the only "new" cards introduced are trash), then extra information can be conveyed by what rank is chosen.
- The rank chosen should correspond to the slot that they should play.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Bob has two pink cards clued in his hand on slot 3 and slot 4. He does not know the rank of either card.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Bob, which touches both pink cards and nothing else.
  - Bob knows that a rank 4 clue means to play slot 4, so he plays his right-most pink card.
  - Bob holds on to the other pink card for later, knowing that the _Pink Choice Tempo Clue_ only "gets" one card.

<ChoiceTempo />

### The Pink Choice Finesse

- The concept of _Pink Choice_ can also be used to initiate a _Finesse_ on a pink card.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - No cards are played on the stacks.
  - Cathy has a clued pink 3 in slot 3 and a clued pink 2 in slot 4. She does not know the rank of either card.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Cathy, which touches both pink cards and nothing else.
  - Bob knows that a number 4 clue means to play slot 4, so the pink 2 must be playable right now. Bob plays his _Finesse Position_ card as pink 1.
  - Cathy plays the pink 2 from slot 4.

<ChoiceFinesse />

### Pink Positional Clues

- Towards the end of the game, a player may have multiple pink cards in their hand, with one of them being playable. If the playable pink card is in between other pink cards, it can be difficult to "get" the card to play.
- In cases where a number clue would be nonsensical, it is an indication to the player with two or more pink cards of which slot to play.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - The pink 4 is played and all of the other 3's are played.
  - Bob's hand is completely unclued.
  - Alice clues Bob number 2, touching slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  - Bob knows that since all of the 3's are already played, this might be a _Trash Chop Move_. If this is the case, slot 1 is focused, and he should discard that card, and then chop move slot 4 and slot 5.
  - However, Bob also knows that it is near the end of the game and there are no cards left to chop move, so this interpretation does not make much sense.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this must be a _Positional Clue_, and he plays his slot 2 card as the pink 5.
- _Positional Clues_ are different from _Pink Choice Tempo Clues_ in that they can touch new cards. (_Pink Choice Tempo Clues_ only re-touch known pink cards.) For this reason, _Positional Clues_ can typically only be done at the end of the game when the clue is not likely to be interpreted as anything else.

<Positional />

<br />

## Level 21 - Bubblegum Moves

- Normally, when players give a clue to a pink card with a number, they exactly match the number of the card in order to satisfy _Pink Promise_.
- Some common situations where players violate _Pink Promise_ are covered in the two different _Pink Play Clue Lie_ sections above.
- It is also possible to violate _Pink Promise_ in a different way: by lying about the rank of a pink card that is not yet playable. Doing so communicates the slot number of where the connecting card is to the other players on the team.
- By unexpectedly playing cards from the matching slot number, the player communicates the true rank of the pink card, which fixes the lie.
- All moves of this nature are called _Bubblegum_.

### The Bubblegum Finesse

- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Donald has a pink 3 in his hand clued with pink. He does not know the rank of the card.
  - Alice clues Donald number 4, which only touches the pink 3.
  - Bob knows that since the pink 3 is the focus of the clue, it must be playable right now. However, if this was a normal _Finesse_ (and Bob had a pink 2 on his _Finesse Position_), then Alice would have used a pink clue or a number 3 clue (to match the real rank of the card, satisfying _Pink Promise_).
  - Bob knows that since Alice did not do either of these things, she must be trying to communicate something extra. This must be a _Bubblegum Finesse_, indicating which slot the pink 2 is in.
  - Bob sees that Cathy has the pink 2 in slot 4. Thus, he knows that the _Bubblegum Finesse_ is not on him. Bob discards.
  - Cathy goes through the same steps as Bob. Cathy does not see the pink 2 anywhere else, so she knows that the _Bubblegum Finesse_ is on her. Cathy blind-plays pink 2 from slot 4.
  - Donald knows that since Cathy played her slot 4 card, this was a _Bubblegum Finesse_. Donald's pink card must be the connecting card. Donald plays the pink 3.

<BubblegumFinesse />

### The Bubblegum Prompt

- Normally, you can only _Prompt_ a card if it is the left-most clued card. However, you can _Prompt_ a non-left-most clued card by violating _Pink Promise_. This is called a _Bubblegum Prompt_, which is conceptually similar to a _Bubblegum Finesse_.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's _Finesse Position_ card has negative pink. He also has three cards clued with number 5 on slot 2, slot 3, and slot 4.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Donald, which focuses a pink 4 on slot 2 and touches a pink 3 on slot 3.
  - Bob sees that in order to make the pink 3 and the pink 4 playable, someone has to have the pink 2. Since no-one else seems to have it, Bob must have it as one of his clued 5's.
  - Given that Alice violated _Pink Promise_, Bob can determine that his pink 2 is on his slot 3. Bob plays his slot 3, and it is the pink 2.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Donald knows that clues do not normally _Prompt_ a non-leftmost card. Thus, Donald knows that the focus of Alice's _Play Clue_ cannot be a 3.
  - The next card after a pink 3 is a pink 4, so Donald knows that the card that Alice focused is a pink 4. Subsequently, since Alice's clue was a _Play Clue_, the pink 4 must be playable. In order for a pink 4 to be playable, someone has to have a pink 3. Donald does not see it anywhere else, so he determines that he must have the pink 3 on slot 3 (since that is the only other clued card that could possibly be a pink 3).
- It is possible for a clue to be both a _Bubblegum Finesse_ and a _Bubblegum Prompt_ at the same time.
  - In the previous example, we can modify Donald's hand such that he only holds the pink 4 (instead of holding both the pink 4 and the pink 3).
  - In the previous example, Cathy discarded, but in the modified example, Cathy would know that the pink 4 was promised to be playable. And Cathy would not see anyone else holding the pink 3, so Cathy would have to respond by playing a pink 3 from her _Finesse Position_.

### The Bubblegum Bluff (Standard Form)

- Similar to a _Bubblegum Finesse_, it is also possible to perform a _Bubblegum Bluff_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching a pink 2 on slot 5.
  - Bob knows that Alice is violating _Pink Promise_. This must mean that he is supposed to play his slot 3 card.
  - Bob blind-plays slot 3 and it is a red 1.
  - Cathy knows that if this were a _3 Bluff_, then Bob would have played his _Finesse Position_. So it cannot be a _3 Bluff_.
  - Thus, Cathy knows that this must be a _Bubblegum_ clue. Since red 1 is not a pink card and Alice was in _Bluff Seat_ for Bob, this must be a _Bubblegum Bluff_.
  - Cathy marks her slot 5 card as the one-away-from-playable pink card, the pink 2.

<BubblegumBluff />

- _Bubblegum Bluffs_ can only be performed on non-pink cards; otherwise, it will look like a _Bubblegum Finesse_.
- Note that it is impossible to _3 Bluff_ and _Bubblegum Bluff_ at the same time.

### The Bubblegum Bluff (Two-Away-From-Playable Form)

- Normally, the clue receiver of a _Bubblegum Bluff_ marks their pink card as the lowest-possible, useful value. (In other words, it is marked as the _one-way-from-playable_ pink card.)
- However, it is sometimes possible that the lowest-possible, useful value of the focused pink card is actually _two-away-from-playable_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a pink 3 on slot 3 as a _Play Clue_. (The pink 3 is currently _two-away-from-playable_.)
  - Bob knows that Alice is violating _Pink Promise_.
  - If Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card and it successfully plays, it is guaranteed to be one of the 1s. If that happened, then Cathy would mark her clued card as the matching 2 and will go on to misplay it.
  - Thus, Bob concludes this is a _Bubblegum Finesse_, with pink 1 in slot 2 and pink 2 in slot 1.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 2, but it is a red 1. It is now revealed to Bob that this was a _Bubblegum Bluff_ instead of a _Bubblegum Finesse_.
  - Cathy knows that if her clued card were really a 2, Bob would have played slot 1. Thus, it cannot be a 2. Furthermore, there are no _Ejections_ that match this situation, so a _Bubblegum_ move must have happened. Normally, a _Bubblegum Bluff_ would be on a _one-away-from-playable_ card, but that would be the pink 2, and due to the circumstances of the clue, it is impossible to be a 2. Thus, it instead must be the _two-away-from-playable_ card, which is the pink 3.

### The Bubblegum Double Bluff

- Normally, after a _Bubblegum Bluff_, the entire team is synchronized on the identity of the focus of the _Bubblegum_ move.
- But what if the note that the clue receiver would write on their card is still incorrect? In this situation, the clue-giver expects additional blind-plays to resynchronize the information, in the same way that a normal _Double Bluff_ works.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Donald, touching a pink 4 on slot 1.
  - Bob knows that Alice is violating _Pink Promise_. This must mean that he is supposed to play his slot 3 card as pink 1, with pink 2 and 3 promised as playable through his current _Finesse Position_ and _Second Finesse Position_, respectively.
  - Bob blind-plays slot 3. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - From Donald's perspective, he knows that Alice performed a _Bubblegum Bluff_. Donald marks his slot 1 card as a pink 2 (i.e. the _one-away-from-playable_ pink card).
  - Next, it is Cathy's turn. Cathy sees that Donald will mark his pink card as a pink 2. However, the card is really a pink 4, so the situation has not yet resolved.
  - Cathy blind-plays her slot 1 card. It is a red 2 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Donald realizes that if his clued card were a pink 2, then Cathy would not have blind-played. Donald also knows that if the card were a pink 3, Bob would have played slot 1 as a _3 Bluff_. Thus, Donald updates the note on his card to be the next pink card, which is the pink 4.
- Note that, in the previous example, the pink 4 happens to be _three-away-from-playable_, but that is not relevant for the move to work properly. A _Bubblegum Double Bluff_ can also be performed with a _two-away-from-playable_ card. What matters is that the team is re-synchronized on the identity of the focus of the _Bubblegum_ clue.

### The Bubblegum Slide

- If a _Bubblegum Prompt_ or a _Bubblegum Finesse_ is telling a player to play a card in a slot that has negative pink, then that is nonsensical.
- In this situation, if there is no other possible interpretation for the clue other than a _Bubblegum Prompt_ or a _Bubblegum Finesse_, and it is unlikely for the cluer to be making a mistake, then the target slot should "slide" to the right.
- If the slot immediately to the right is also impossible to be a pink card, then it should continue to slide right until it finds a pink card, wrapping around to the other side of the hand if necessary.

<br />

## Level 21 - Other Special Moves

### The Turnabout Ejection

- If a player violates _Pink Promise_ to falsely indicate a pink 5 as a 1, **or** a playable pink card as a 5, this is a dangerous lie that must be immediately resolved.
- In this situation, the next player must immediately play their _Second Finesse Position_ to prove what happened. This is called a _Turnabout Ejection_.
- After the _Ejection_, the player who received the clue will know that the focused card's identity has been "reversed".
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, which touches a pink 1 on Cathy's chop.
  - Bob knows that Alice is violating _Pink Promise_. This must be a _Turnabout Ejection_.
  - Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_ (slot 2). It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - At first, Cathy thought that the number 5 clue from Alice was a _5 Save_.
  - After Bob blind-plays, Cathy knows that Alice did not perform a _5 Save_ and instead did something else.
  - Cathy knows that Alice did not perform a _Bubblegum Bluff_, because Bob would have played his slot 5 card instead of his slot 2 card.
  - Thus, Cathy knows that this must be a _Turnabout Ejection_. She marks her slot 5 card as a pink 1.

<TurnaboutEjection />

- If a _Turnabout Ejection_ occurs from a number 1 clue that also touches other 1s, the non-focused cards should still be assumed to be 1s (using the _1's Assumption_ convention).
- During the _Early Game_, _Turnabout Ejections_ take precedence over _Bad Chop Move Ejections (with 5's)_. Afterwards, _Bad Chop Move Ejection_ takes precedence.
- _Turnabout Ejections (with 5's)_ can only be performed with non-trash cards.
- _Turnabout Ejections (with 1's)_ cannot be performed once all 1's have been played.

### The Pink Fake Prompt & The Pink Fake Finesse

- First, see the section on the _[Pink Play Clue Lie](#the-pink-play-clue-lie-ppcl-with-a-mismatched-play-clue-that-touches-other-cards)_.
- In the _Pink Play Clue Lie_, _Pink Promise_ is violated when giving a _Play Clue_ to a playable pink card. However, no special actions need to be taken from anyone else on the team, because the lie will automatically resolve when the card is played.
- In some special situations, it is possible to give a _Pink Play Clue Lie_ that will **not** resolve automatically. In this situation, the next player must play a card to "fix" the lie.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice gives a number 2 clue to Cathy, touching a pink 1 on slot 2. (Cathy does not have a playable card on slot 1.)
  - Bob knows that if he does nothing, Cathy will go on to interpret this as a _Self-Finesse_, and play her _Finesse Position_, which will misplay.
  - Thus, Bob plays his _Finesse Position_ as a _Pink Fake Finesse_. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - From Cathy's perspective, Alice performed a _Finesse_ on the blue 1 into the blue 2. Cathy plays the blue 2, but it is actually the pink 1. Now, Cathy knows that Alice performed a _Pink Fake Finesse_.
- Rarely, _Pink Fake Finesses_ can be performed _Out of Position_, but only if the _Finessed_ card plays into an ancillary-touched card. (This turns the "fake" _Finesse_ into a "real" _Finesse_ on the non-focused card.)

## Level 21 - Edge Cases

### Trash Finesses & Trash Bluffs in Pink

- When a _Trash Finesse_ or a _Trash Bluff_ happens in a normal variant, if more than one card is touched, then all of the touched cards are known to be trash.
- When a _Trash Finesse_ or a _Trash Bluff_ happens in a variant with a pink suit, if more than one card is touched, and the clue was a number clue, it is possible that only the focused card was trash, and that the other cards touched are useful / critical pink cards.
- In this situation, after discarding the focus of the _Trash Finesse_ or _Trash Bluff_, the player should then hold on to the other touched cards.

### Trash Charms in Pink

- As mentioned in the previous section, any non-focused cards in a _Trash Finesse_ or _Trash Bluff_ must be good according to _Good Touch Principle_.
- If both the focused card and all of the non-focused cards are trash, then this would cause an _Unknown Trash Charm_.

### Trash Pushes in Pink

- When a _Trash Push_ happens in a normal variant, if more than one card is touched, then all of the touched cards are known to be trash.
- When a _Trash Push_ happens with a rank clue in a variant with a pink suit, if more than one card is touched, it is possible that only the card on chop was trash, and that the other cards touched are useful / critical pink cards.
- In this situation, after blind-playing the _Trash Pushed_ card, the player should first discard the card that initiated the _Trash Push_ (the oldest card) and then hold on to the other touched cards.
  - In this situation, _Good Touch Principle_ applies to the other touched cards. The other members of the team must give a _Fix Clue_ to those cards if they are also trash.

### Pink Precedence

- The _Bubblegum_ conventions usually take precedence over other kinds of moves. Specifically:
  - The _Bubblegum_ conventions take precedence over a _Rank Choice Ejection (with 2)_.
  - The _Bubblegum_ conventions take precedence over an _Unknown Trash Discharge_.
  - The _Bubblegum Bluff_ holds equal precedence to a _4 Charm_. Thus, the clued player must write identity notes for both options (including the pink 4).
  - A true _Bubblegum Finesse_ takes precedence over _4 Charm_. (This is because, unlike in the _Bluff_ scenarios, the pink blind-play "connects" to the rank clue).
- Note that _Trash Bluff_ still takes precedence over a _Bubblegum Finesse_ and a _Bubblegum Bluff_. For example, in a 3 player game:
  - Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a red 1 as a _Trash Finesse_.
  - Bob blind-plays a pink 1.
  - Cathy knows that this is either a _Trash Finesse_ or a _Bubblegum Finesses_:
    - If Alice's clue was a _Trash Finesse_, then her clued card is either a red 1 or a blue 1.
    - If Alice's clue was a _Bubblegum Finesse_, then her clued card is a pink 2.
  - Cathy knows that _Trash Finesses_ take precedence over a _Bubblegum Finesse_, so the card must be a red 1 or blue 1, and can be safely discarded.

### Pink Promise with a 5 Stall

- When a player performs a _5 Stall_, it is clearly a type of _Save Clue_. But if two or more 5's are touched as part of the clue, the focus of the clue is unclear.
- We define the focus of the clue to be the specific 5 that is closest to the chop.
- Thus, when a player knows for sure that a number 5 clue indicates a _5 Stall_, _Pink Promise_ only applies to the 5 that is closest to the chop.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - The variant is "Pink (6 Suits)".
  - It is the _Early Game_ and all of the _Play Clues_ and _Save Clues_ have been extinguished.
  - Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching two 5's on slot 1 and slot 2.
  - Bob knows that this is a _5 Stall_. Bob knows that the clue is either focused on slot 1 or slot 2.
  - Because of the "Pink Promise with a 5 Stall" convention, Bob knows that since this clue is focused on slot 2.
  - Thus, _Pink Promise_ applies to this card, so he marks slot 2 as a 5.
  - Later on in the game, another rank clue "fills in" Bob's slot 2 card to be a pink card. From _Pink Promise_, Bob knows that it must be exactly the pink 5.

### Pink Promise with a 5's Chop Move

- First, see the section on _[Pink Promise with a 5 Stall](#pink-promise-with-a-5-stall)_.
- When a player performs a _5's Chop Move_, it is clearly a type of _Save Clue_. But if two or more 5's are touched as part of the clue, the focus of the clue is unclear.
- We define the focus of the clue to be the specific 5 that is one-away from the chop. (This is similar to how _Pink Promise_ works with a _5 Stall_.)
- Thus, when a player knows for sure that a number 5 clue indicates a _5's Chop Move_, _Pink Promise_ only applies to the 5 that is one-away from the chop.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - The variant is "Pink (6 Suits)".
  - It is the middle of the game and no 5's are yet playable.
  - Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching two 5's on slot 1 and slot 4.
  - Bob knows that this is a _5's Chop Move_, and marks his slot 5 card as being _Chop Moved_.
  - Bob knows that the clue is either focused on slot 1 or slot 4.
  - Because of the "Pink Promise with a 5's Chop Move" convention, Bob knows that since this clue caused him to _Chop Move_, it is focused on slot 4.
  - Thus, _Pink Promise_ applies to this card, so he marks slot 4 as a 5.
  - Later on in the game, another rank clue "fills in" Bob's slot 4 card to be a pink card. From _Pink Promise_, Bob knows that it must be exactly the pink 5.

### Pink Promise with a Trash Chop Move

- First, see the section on _[Pink Promise with a 5's Chop Move](#pink-promise-with-a-5s-chop-move)_.
- In a _5's Chop Move_:
  - The focus of the clue is the 5 that is one-away from chop.
  - _Pink Promise_ applies to the focused 5.
  - Other cards, if any, are not necessarily promised to be anything.
- This same convention applies to a _Trash Chop Move_ given with a number clue. In a _Trash Chop Move_ given with a number clue:
  - The focus of the clue is the trash card that is closest to chop.
  - _Pink Promise_ applies to the focus of the clue.
  - Other cards, if any, are not necessarily promised to be anything.

### Pink Promise with a 5 Pull

- First, see the section on _[Pink Promise with a 5's Chop Move](#pink-promise-with-a-5s-chop-move)_.
- When a player performs a _5 Pull_, it is clearly a type of _Play Clue_. But if two or more 5's are touched as part of the clue, then the focus of the clue is unclear.
- We define the focus of the clue to be the next to the "pulled" card. (This is similar to how _Pink Promise_ works with a _5's Chop Move_.)
- Thus, when a player knows for sure that a number 5 clue indicates a _5 Pull_, _Pink Promise_ only applies to the 5 that is next to the pulled card.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - The variant is "Pink (6 Suits)".
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching two 5's on slot 1 and slot 2.
  - Bob knows that this is a _5 Pull_, because he sees that Cathy has a bunch of playable cards in her hand that Alice could have clued instead.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 3. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Next, Bob retroactively considers the implications of the _5 Pull_. Bob knows that the _5 Pull_ was either focused on slot 1 or slot 2.
  - Because of the "Pink Promise with a 5 Pull" convention, Bob knows that since this clue was a _5 Pull_, it must be focused on slot 2 (the card that was next to the pulled card).
  - Thus, _Pink Promise_ applies to this card, so he marks slot 2 as a 5.
  - Later on in the game, another rank clue "fills in" Bob's slot 2 card to be a pink card. From _Pink Promise_, Bob knows that it must be exactly the pink 5.
