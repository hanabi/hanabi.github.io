These conventions apply to any variant with a prism suit.

### Prism Hard Color Bluff (if is not One-Away-From-Playable)

- For the purposes of *Finesses*, prism cards only "connect" if they are the direct next color.
- For example, in a 3-player game of *Prism (5 Suits)*:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues green to Cathy, touching a prism 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays a prism 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - From Cathy's perspective, she knows that prism 3 is green, and that since green clue connects to a prism 3, this could be a *Double Finesse*. (If this was a *Double Finesse*, then Cathy would be called on to blind-play the prism 2 from her own hand as a *Self Finesse*.)
  - However, Cathy knows that *Prism Hard Color Bluffs* take precedence over *Double Finesses*. Thus, Cathy marks her clued card as either green 3 or prism 3, then discards.

### Color Bluffs (Two-Away-From-Playable)

- Players can perform a *Bluff* on a prism card with a color, as long as the focus of the clue is a valid *Bluff* target and the color represents a prism card that is *two-or-more-away-from-playable*.
- As a consequence of this, you can *Bluff* a prism 1 by cluing a prism 3 (with color).
- For example, in a 3-player game of *Prism (5 Suits)*:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues green to Cathy, touching a prism 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays a prism 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy knows that prism 1 would connect to yellow, but it does not connect to green. Thus, this is just a *Bluff*.
  - Cathy marks her green card as either a green 2 (as a normal *Bluff*), a green 3 (as a *3 Bluff*), or a prism 3 (as a *Hard 3 Bluff*).

### The Ambiguous Prism Tempo Clue

- Sometimes, players have a clued prism card in their hand that matches a clued normal card in their hand.
- For example, in a "Prism (5 Suits)" game:
  - Bob has a blue 4 and a prism 4 in his hand. Both have been previously clued with a blue color clue, but Bob does not know the true identity of either card.
- In this situation, it is hard to give a *Tempo Clue* to the right-most card. Thus, we agree that:
  - a color *Tempo Clue* should focus the right-most card
  - a rank *Tempo Clue* should focus the left most card

#### Interaction with the Tempo Clue Chop Move

- *Ambiguous Prism Tempo Clues* are considered to be high-value. Thus, we agree to never *Chop Move* from these types of clues.
