These conventions apply to the "Cow & Pig" variants.

<br />

### No Color Saves

- Rank clues (oink) are always used to perform a _Save Clue_.
- Color clues (moo) must always be _Play Clues_.

### Reverse Finesse Restriction

- It is illegal to perform a _Reverse Finesse_ with a rank clue on the first turn. (This makes things more clear for players when they are given a _Save Clue_ and there are some playable cards on _Finesse Position_ to get.)

### Advanced Conventions

- In Cow & Pig variants, _Ejections_ and _Discharges_ work quite differently. See the [Specific Conventions for Variants with No Positive Clues](no-positive-clues.mdx).
