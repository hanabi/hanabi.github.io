title: Specific Conventions for 3 Suits
---

These conventions apply to any variant with only 3 suits.

<br />

### No 3 Bluffs

- The *3 Bluff* convention is "turned off". (This is because *Double Finesses* are much more likely in these variants.)

### The Full Finesse

- The following conventions are "turned off":
  - *5 Stall*
  - *5's Chop Move*
  - *5 Pull*
  - *5 Color Ejection*
  - *5 Number Discharge*
- If a 5 is clued, then it is to be treated as a *Finesse* on the full suit from 1 to 5.
