### Positional Layered Finesse Turned Off

- The _Positional Layered Finesse_ is turned off. Another way of saying this is that players are allowed to perform a _Positional Clues_ to get a non-null cards to play. After the first positional blind-play, no extra cards are promised.
- In general, players should prefer to use "normal" moves over _Positional Clues_, since they add extra confusion to the game. However, there might be a tricky situation in which a _Positional Clue_ for a non-null card is necessary.
