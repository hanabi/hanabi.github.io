These conventions apply to the Chimneys and Funnels variants.

### Pink Promise

- _[Pink Promise](pink.mdx#pink-promise)_ applies. (_Pink Promise_ is the main convention in variants with a pink suit.)

### Useless Rank Chop Moves

- In Chimneys and Funnels the two number clues which touch the most cards are largely useless because of how many are touched by them.
  - In Funnels these are the number 4 and 5 clues.
  - In Chimneys these are the number 2 and 1 clues.
- Cards touched with these number clues do not count as being touched for the purposes of discarding, _Good Touch Principle_, and so forth.
- Instead, the number clue which touches all cards _Chop Moves_ two cards while the other one _Chop Moves_ one card.
  - As in, in Funnels number 4 clue _Chop Moves_ once while number 5 clue _Chop Moves_ twice.
  - As in, in Chimneys number 2 clue _Chop Moves_ once while number 1 clue _Chop Moves_ twice.
