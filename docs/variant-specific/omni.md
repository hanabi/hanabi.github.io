These conventions apply to any variant with an omni (touched by all clues) suit.

### Pink Conventions

- All pink conventions also apply to omni cards.

### Soft Good Touch Principle

- Sometimes, players can play cards "automatically" from *Good Touch Principle*.
- For example, if the blue 4 and the omni 5 are played on the stacks, then a remaining blue card would be a known blue 5, and would be automatically played without any additional clues being given.
- However, due to the nature of omni cards, it is common for clues to "pick up" trash omni cards.
- Thus, players should **not** automatically play cards from *Good Touch Principle* in this manner.
- However, players should still play clued cards if they could be part of a *Prompt*.
- For example:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a card marked in his has with a number 1 clue.
  - From *Good Touch Principle*, Bob knows that the card as either omni 2, omni 3, omni 4, or omni 5.
  - Alice gives a *Play Clue* to an omni 3 in Cathy's hand.
  - Bob knows that he is *Prompted* for the omni 2. He plays the number 1 card (as opposed to blind-playing slot 1 as a *Finesse*).
