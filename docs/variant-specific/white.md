These conventions apply to any variant with a white suit (i.e. touched by no colors).

### The Loaded Play Clue Assumption

- Since it can be hard to get white cards on chop to play, we agree to turn on *Loaded Play Clues* for white cards.
- Furthermore, players are not allowed to *Early Save* any card with a rank clue when the white card of that rank is playable. This is because the player who receives the clue will assume that it is a *Loaded Play Clue* on a white card and will play it. This is called the *Loaded Play Play Clue Assumption*.
- Note that *Loaded Play Clues* of this form can be **on cards that are not white**, because the player who receives the clue will not be able to tell the difference.
- Normally, *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned off" in the *Early Game*. However, note that the *Loaded Play Clue Assumption* still applies in the *Early Game*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - White 2 and red 2 are played on the stacks. Blue 3 is in the trash.
  - Bob has a globally-known playable green 1 in his hand.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a 3 on Bob's chop.
  - Normally, Bob would interpret this as an *Early Save* on the blue 3.
  - However, Bob knows that white 3 is currently playable and that he is *Loaded*. Thus, this must be a *Play Clue* on either a white 3 or a red 3.
- As an exception, the *Loaded Play Clue Assumption* does not apply to number 5 clues in the *Low Score Phase*.

### The Loaded White Finesse

- Because of the *Loaded Play Clue Assumption*, it is also possible to perform a *Finesse* (or a *Bluff*) by giving a *Loaded Play Clue* to a white card.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy has a globally-known playable red 1 in her hand.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a white 2 on her chop.
  - Normally, Bob would interpret this as an *Early 2 Save* on the white 2.
  - However, Bob knows that *Early Saves* are not allowed on white cards. Thus, this must a *Finesse* for white 1.
  - Bob blind-plays slot 1 and it is the white 1.
