These conventions apply to the "Special-Fives" variants (e.g. "Pink-Fives").

<br />

### Special 5 Saves

- This convention only applies to any variant where it is not possible to clue number 5.
- Since 5's cannot be _5 Saved_, a number 2 clue must be used to save them as a pseudo-_2 Save_.

### Special 5 Saves for Muddy-Rainbow-Fives

- This convention only applies to a variant where you have Muddy-Rainbow-Fives.
- Since 5's cannot be _5 Saved_, a red clue must be used to save them as a muddy rainbow save.
- Similar to muddy rainbow saves, the Always Loaded Principle applies to these saves.
- Similar to muddy rainbow saves, in the special case of a variant where a one-of-each-card color is available, the one-of-each-card color should be used instead of red.
