These conventions apply to the "Special-Fives" variants (e.g. "Pink-Fives", "Muddy-Rainbow-Fives", etc.).

<br />

## Brown-Fives

### Special 5 Saves for Brown-Fives

- This convention only applies to variants with Brown-Fives.
- Since 5's cannot be saved with a number 5 clue, they must be saved with their own color.
- Color clues to chop should be treated first and foremost as 5-saves.
- The _Always Loaded Principle_ applies to color clues given to chop.


## Deceptive-Fives

### Deceptive 5 Saves

- Any color clue to a chop card is first and foremost to be treated as a _Save Clue_ on a 5.

### Deceptive Loaded Play Clues

- _Loaded Play Clues_ are turned on but only apply to the color clues focusing on _Chop_.

### Rank Save Promise

- The rank of a _Chop-Focus_ number clue must match the number of the card. In other words, players are not allowed to use a rank clue to touch a 5 if it is on chop.

### Deceptive-Five Number Ejection

- If a player breaks the _Rank Save Promise_, they must be intending to send an additional message.
- In this situation, the intent is to have the next player _Eject_. When this happens, the clue receiver should mark their card as a 5.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice gives a number 3 clue, touching a green 5 in Cathy's hand.
  - If Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_, then Cathy would mark her card as a 3, which would be bad.
  - Instead, Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_ as a _Deceptive-Five Number Ejection_. It is a yellow 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that an _Ejection_ happened. The only _Ejection_ that matches this sequence of events is a _Deceptive-Five Number Ejection_, so she marks her 3 as a 5.

### The Ambiguous Deceptive-Five Tempo Clue

- The _Ambiguous Tempo Clue_ convention applies, and we agree that:
  - a color _Tempo Clue_ should focus the right-most card.
  - an odd or even _Tempo Clue_ should focus the left most card.


## Null-Fives

### Null 4 Tech

- In this variant, it is not possible to clue the number 5 to take advantage of the _Null_ conventions.
- The usual _Null_ conventions apply, but with all number 5 clue conventions replaced with number 4 clues.
- The _Loaded 5 Tech Clue_ instead means that when Bob is loaded and a previously unclued 4 is clued with a number 4 clue, the default conventional interpretation applies.


## Rainbow-Fives

### Color Promise

- When giving a color clue to a rainbow-one or a rainbow-five, you are expected to use the color that matches the card.
- There are some exceptions, which are listed below.

### The Color Play Clue Lie

- First, see the section on the _[Pink Play Clue Lie](pink.mdx#the-pink-play-clue-lie-ppcl-with-a-mismatched-play-clue-that-touches-other-cards)_ (for pink variants).
- Similar to how the _Pink Play Clue Lie_ violates _Pink Promise_, you can do a _Color Play Clue Lie_ to violate _Color Promise_ in the same way.
- In other words, you can break _Color Promise_ if and only if:
  - using a "wrong" color would get extra cards (e.g. a 2-for-1 instead of a 1-for-1)
  - the card would play immediately or very soon
  - no-one else would be confused
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - The variant is "Rainbow-Ones (6 Suits)".
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, touching a blue 1 on slot 1 and a red 3 on slot 2.
  - Bob assumes that it is red 1 and plays it. It is instead the blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Bob reasons that Alice lied about the color identity of the 1 so that she could "get" the card on his slot 2 "for free".

### The Color Promise Finesse

- First, see the section on the _[Color Play Clue Lie](#the-color-play-clue-lie)_.
- Usually, when _Color Promise_ is violated, it is a _Color Play Clue Lie_. But what if _Color Promise_ is violated and the clue is only a 1-for-1? The clue giver must be trying to communicate something extra.
- In this situation, the next player should blind-play their _Finesse Position_ card as a _Color Promise Finesse_.
- For example, in 3-player game:
  - The variant is "Rainbow-Ones (6 Suits)".
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a blue 1 on slot 1.
  - Bob sees that Cathy's hand has no other blue cards in it, so there is no good reason why Alice could not have just clued blue to Cathy and satisfied _Color Promise_. Alice must be trying to communicate something extra.
  - Bob knows that this is a _Color Promise Finesse_ and blind-plays his finesse position. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that Alice performed a _Finesse_ and that Cathy must have the red 2 that connects to the red 1 that was blind-played.
  - Cathy plays the red card and it is blue 1. It successfully plays.
  - Cathy now knows that Alice performed a _Color Promise Finesse_ instead of a normal _Finesse_.
- Note that the _Color Promise Finesse_ can only be performed if the card that is blind-played connects to the clue that was given. Otherwise, Cathy will think that a _Bluff_ happened and will not play the clued card.

### The Color Prompt Exception (for Rainbow-Ones)

- First, see the section on the _[Pink Prompt Rank Exception](pink.mdx#the-pink-prompt-rank-exception)_ (for pink variants).
- Similar to how there is a _Pink Prompt Rank Exception_ for pink cards, there is also a _Color Prompt Exception_ for rainbow-ones.
- In other words, cards in a player's hand that are clued with a single color clue are not treated to be a potential 1.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Bob's slot 2 card has a green clue on it (and no other positive or negative clues).
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 2 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that if the green card in his hand is red 1, then this would be a _Prompt_.
  - Bob knows that if the green card in his hand is not red 1, then this would be a _Finesse_.
  - Bob knows that normally, _Prompts_ are supposed to take precedence over _Finesses_. However, in this case, since his green card only has a single color clue on it, the _Color Prompt Exception_ applies, so he should assume a finesse.
  - Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.

### Mud Clues

- _Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clues_ (defined below) are turned on.


## Pink-Fives & Omni-Fives & Light-Pink Fives

### Special 5 Saves for Pink-Fives & Omni-Fives & Light-Pink Fives

- This convention only applies to variants with Pink-Fives, Omni-Fives, and Light-Pink Fives.
- Since 5's cannot be saved with a number 5 clue, they must be saved with a number 2 clue as a pseudo-_2 Save_.
- The _Always Loaded Principle_ applies to pseudo-_2 Saves_.

### Mud Clues

- _Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clues_ (defined below) are turned on.


## Muddy-Rainbow-Fives

### Mud Clues

- _Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clues_ (defined below) are turned on.

### Special 5 Saves for Muddy-Rainbow-Fives

- This convention only applies to variants with Muddy-Rainbow-Fives.
- Since 5's cannot be saved with a number 5 clue, a red clue must be used to save them as a _Muddy Rainbow Save_.
- Similar to _Muddy Rainbow Saves_, the _Always Loaded Principle_ applies.
- Similar to _Muddy Rainbow Saves_, in the special case of a variant where a one-of-each card color is available (like black), the one-of-each card color should be used instead of red.


## Mud Clues

- When one or more rainbow or omni cards are retouched with a color clue, and there are no "new" cards introduced (or, if the only "new" cards introduced are trash), then extra information can be conveyed by what color is chosen. The color chosen should correspond to the slot that they should play.
- This is called a _Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clue_, or just a _Mud Clue_ for short.
- The position of the rainbow or omni card, counted **from oldest to newest**, corresponds to the ordering of the colors **from right to left**, skipping the cards that are not touched by the color clue (and the known unplayable cards). Furthermore, colors always "wrap around" to the oldest card.
- _Muddy Rainbow Choice Tempo Clues_ may not get single-colored cards.
  - An exception to this rule can be made for extremely difficult variants. If the team needs to get a single-colored card for some specific purpose (e.g. to "unlock" another player), and there was not another good way to "get" the card, then it should be clear to everyone what is happening.

### Mud Clues (Skipping Over Unplayable Cards)

- If known-unplayable cards are touched as part of a _Mud Clue_, then they should be skipped over.
