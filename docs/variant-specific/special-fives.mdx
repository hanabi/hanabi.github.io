These conventions apply to the "Special-Fives" variants (e.g. "Pink-Fives", "Muddy-Rainbow-Fives", etc.).

<br />

## Rainbow-Fives

### Color Promise

- When giving a color clue to a rainbow-five, you are expected to use the color that matches the card.
- There are some exceptions, which are listed below.

### The Color Play Clue Lie

- First, see the section on the _[Pink Play Clue Lie](pink.mdx#the-pink-play-clue-lie-ppcl-with-a-mismatched-play-clue-that-touches-other-cards)_ (for pink variants).
- Similar to how the _Pink Play Clue Lie_ violates _Pink Promise_, you can do a _Color Play Clue Lie_ to violate _Color Promise_ in the same way.
- In other words, you can break _Color Promise_ if and only if:
  - using a "wrong" color would get extra cards (e.g. a 2-for-1 instead of a 1-for-1)
  - the card would play immediately or very soon
  - no-one else would be confused

### The Color Promise Finesse

- First, see the section on the _[Color Play Clue Lie](#the-color-play-clue-lie)_.
- Usually, when _Color Promise_ is violated, it is a _Color Play Clue Lie_. But what if _Color Promise_ is violated and the clue is only a 1-for-1? The clue giver must be trying to communicate something extra.
- In this situation, the next player should blind-play their _Finesse Position_ card as a _Color Promise Finesse_.
- Note that the _Color Promise Finesse_ can only be performed if the card that is blind-played connects to the clue that was given. Otherwise, Cathy will think that a _Bluff_ happened and will not play the clued card.

### Mud Clues

- [_Mud Clues_](muddy-rainbow-cocoa-rainbow.mdx#mud-clues) (from muddy rainbow variants) also apply to rainbow-fives.

## Pink-Fives

### Special 5 Saves for Pink-Fives

- Since 5's cannot be saved with a number 5 clue, they must be saved with a number 2 clue as a pseudo-_2 Save_.
- The _Always Loaded Principle_ applies to pseudo-_2 Saves_.

### The Pink Play Clue Lie (on 5's) (Illegal)

- First, see the section on the [_Pink Play Clue Lie_](pink.mdx#the-pink-play-clue-lie-ppcl-with-a-mismatched-play-clue-that-touches-other-cards).
- Even though it is not possible to clue number 5 in some special-fives variants, [_Pink Promise_](pink.mdx#pink-promise) still applies to the rank clues given. In other words, players are not expected to account for the possibility of a playable 5 when they receive a non-5 rank clue.
  - The only exception to _Pink Promise_ is for pseudo-_2 Saves_.
- Subsequently, if a player lies about the identity of a 5 with a _Pink Play Clue Lie_, it risks losing the game, since the receiving player might perform a _Gentleman's Discard_ (or be otherwise confused about the identity of the card in such a way that causes a cascading failure).
- For this reason, these kind of clues are only typically given as a last resort. (Color clues should be given instead in order to get a 5 to play.)
- In addition to _Pink Promise_ applying to rank clues on playable cards, it also applies to rank clues used on trash cards. In other words, a number 1 clue that indicates either a _Trash Chop Move_ or a play clue on a 5 would indicate the former.

### The Turnabout Ejection

- First, see the section on the [_Turnabout Ejection_](pink.mdx#the-turnabout-ejection), which is a pink convention.
- _Turnabout Ejections_ can be performed on pink-fives.

### No 5 Tech

- Since you cannot clue number 5 in these variants, the following conventions are "turned off":
  - _5 Stall_
  - _5's Chop Move_
  - _5 Pull_
  - _5 Number Ejection_
  - _5 Number Discharge_

## Brown-Fives

### Special 5 Saves for Brown-Fives

- Since 5's cannot be saved with a number 5 clue, they must be saved with their own color.
- Color clues to chop should be treated first and foremost as 5-saves.
- The _Always Loaded Principle_ applies to color clues given to chop.

## Omni-Fives

- All of the conventions from [pink-fives](#pink-fives) also apply to omni-fives.

## Null-Fives

### Null 4 Tech

- In this variant, it is not possible to clue the number 5 to take advantage of the _Null_ conventions.
- The usual _Null_ conventions apply, but with all number 5 clue conventions replaced with number 4 clues.
- The _Loaded 5 Tech Clue_ instead means that when Bob is loaded and a previously unclued 4 is clued with a number 4 clue, the default conventional interpretation applies.

## Muddy-Rainbow-Fives

### Special 5 Saves for Muddy-Rainbow-Fives

- Since 5's cannot be saved with a number 5 clue, a red clue must be used to save them as a _Muddy Rainbow Save_.
- Similar to _Muddy Rainbow Saves_, the _Always Loaded Principle_ applies.
- Similar to _Muddy Rainbow Saves_, in the special case of a variant where a one-of-each card color is available (like black), the one-of-each card color should be used instead of red.

### Mud Clues

- [_Mud Clues_](muddy-rainbow-cocoa-rainbow.mdx#mud-clues) (from muddy rainbow variants) also apply to muddy-rainbow-fives.

## Light-Pink Fives

- All of the conventions from [pink-fives](#pink-fives) also apply to light-pink-fives.

### Rank Play Clues on 5s

- _Pink Promise_ does not apply to rank clues that could represent a playable light-pink-five. (This is different from how _Pink Promise_ works in a pink-fives variant.)
- Thus, when players receive a rank _Play Clue_, they have to account for the being both the true rank and any playable light-pink-fives.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 and blue 4 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a single card on slot 1.
  - Bob knows that this must be a _Play Clue_. Bob marks the card as either the red 3 or the blue 5.

### Mud Clues

- [_Mud Clues_](muddy-rainbow-cocoa-rainbow.mdx#mud-clues) (from muddy rainbow variants) also apply to omni-fives.

## Deceptive-Fives

### Deceptive 5 Saves

- Any color clue to a chop card is first and foremost to be treated as a _Save Clue_ on a 5.

### Deceptive Loaded Play Clues

- _Loaded Play Clues_ are turned on but only apply to the color clues focusing on _Chop_.

### Rank Save Promise

- The rank of a _Chop-Focus_ number clue must match the number of the card. In other words, players are not allowed to use a rank clue to touch a 5 if it is on chop.

### Deceptive-Five Number Ejection

- If a player breaks the _Rank Save Promise_, they must be intending to send an additional message.
- In this situation, the intent is to have the next player _Eject_. When this happens, the clue receiver should mark their card as a 5.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice gives a number 3 clue, touching a green 5 in Cathy's hand.
  - If Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_, then Cathy would mark her card as a 3, which would be bad.
  - Instead, Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_ as a _Deceptive-Five Number Ejection_. It is a yellow 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that an _Ejection_ happened. The only _Ejection_ that matches this sequence of events is a _Deceptive-Five Number Ejection_, so she marks her 3 as a 5.

### The Ambiguous Deceptive-Five Tempo Clue

- The _Ambiguous Tempo Clue_ convention applies, and we agree that:
  - a color _Tempo Clue_ should focus the right-most card.
  - an odd or even _Tempo Clue_ should focus the left most card.
