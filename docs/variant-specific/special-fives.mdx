These conventions apply to the "Special-Fives" variants (e.g. "Pink-Fives", "Muddy-Rainbow-Fives", etc.).

<br />

### Special 5 Saves

- This convention only applies to variants where it is not possible to clue number 5.
- Since 5's cannot be _5 Saved_, a number 2 clue must be used to save them as a pseudo-_2 Save_.

### Special 5 Saves for Muddy-Rainbow-Fives

- This convention only applies to variants with Muddy-Rainbow-Fives.
- Since 5's cannot be _5 Saved_, a red clue must be used to save them as a _Muddy Rainbow Save_.
- Similar to _Muddy Rainbow Saves_, the _Always Loaded Principle_ applies.
- Similar to _Muddy Rainbow Saves_, in the special case of a variant where a one-of-each card color is available (like black), the one-of-each card color should be used instead of red.

### Special 5 Saves for Brown-Fives

- This convention only applies to variants with Brown-Fives.
- Since 5's cannot be _5 Saved_, they must be saved with their own color.
- Color clues to chop should be treated first and foremost as 5-saves.
- The _Always Loaded Principle_ applies to color clues given to chop.
