These conventions apply to the "Special-Fives" variants (e.g. "Pink-Fives", "Muddy-Rainbow-Fives", etc.).

<br />

### Special 5 Saves for Rainbow-Fives & White-Fives

- Since Rainbow-Fives and White-Fives can be _5-Saved_ normally, there does not need to be any special conventions for these variants.

### Special 5 Saves for Pink-Fives & Omni-Fives & Light-Pink Fives

- This convention only applies to variants with Pink-Fives, Omni-Fives, and Light-Pink Fives.
- Since 5's cannot be saved with a number 5 clue, they must be saved with a number 2 clue as a pseudo-_2 Save_.
- The _Always Loaded Principle_ applies to pseudo-_2 Saves_.

### Special 5 Saves for Brown-Fives

- This convention only applies to variants with Brown-Fives.
- Since 5's cannot be saved with a number 5 clue, they must be saved with their own color.
- Color clues to chop should be treated first and foremost as 5-saves.
- The _Always Loaded Principle_ applies to color clues given to chop.

### Special 5 Saves for Muddy-Rainbow-Fives

- This convention only applies to variants with Muddy-Rainbow-Fives.
- Since 5's cannot be saved with a number 5 clue, a red clue must be used to save them as a _Muddy Rainbow Save_.
- Similar to _Muddy Rainbow Saves_, the _Always Loaded Principle_ applies.
- Similar to _Muddy Rainbow Saves_, in the special case of a variant where a one-of-each card color is available (like black), the one-of-each card color should be used instead of red.
