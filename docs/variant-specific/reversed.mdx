These conventions apply to any variant with a reversed suit (cards must be played as 5 --> 4 --> 3 --> 2 --> 1).

<br />

### The 1 Save

- Similar to the _5 Save_, you can also do a _1 Save_ in order to save the reversed 1. (There is only one copy of a reversed 1.)
- Any number 1 clue to a chop card is first and foremost respected as a _1 Save_ (as opposed to a _Play Clue_ on a playable 1).
- If a _1 Save_ touches more than one 1, the non-chop 1s can be played as per normal.

### The Fix Clue That Re-Touches 1's

- Normally, when 1's are re-clued with number 1 before they are all played, it means to skip over the next one because it is trash.
- In a variant with a reversed suit, it means instead that the card is the reversed 1.
- For example:
  - Alice clues Bob number 1 and it touches three 1's.
  - Bob plays the oldest 1. There are now two 1's left in his hand.
  - Before Bob can play the next 1, Alice clues Bob number 1 again, and all the clue does is re-touch the remaining 1's.
  - Now it is Bob's turn. Since he was going to play the 1 already without Alice doing anything, the clue must have some other meaning.
  - Thus, it must be a _Fix Clue_. Just like in a no variant game, Bob skips over the 1 that he was about to play and plays the other one. It successfully plays.
  - In a no variant game, Bob would know that the 1 that he skipped over would be trash and he could safely discard it on his next turn. However, since this is a reversed variant, Bob instead assumes that the skipped over 1 is exactly the reversed 1. He saves the card for later.

### No Play Clues with a Number 5 Clue

- In a no variant game, all number 5 clues in the _Low Score Phase_ are never to be interpreted as a _Play Clue_. If players want to get some 5 to play, they must clue it with color.
- This convention also applies to variants with a reversed suit. If players want to get a reversed 5 to play, they must clue it with color.
- This means that _5 Stalls_, _5's Chop Moves_, and _5 Pulls_ will still "work" like they normally do, even in a variant with a reversed suit.
- The exception to this rule is when playing a variant with a white reversed suit:
  - In this case, as long as the reversed white 5 is not yet played, all _5 Stalls_, _5's Chop Moves_, and _5 Pulls_ are "turned off".
  - Instead, any number 5 clue will just look like a simple _Play Clue_ on a reversed white 5.
  - Once the reversed white 5 is played, these three conventions are turned back on.

### No 2 Saves on a Reversed 2

- It is illegal to perform a _2 Save_ on a reversed 2.
- Any number 2 clue that looks like a _2 Save_ on a reversed 2 is instead to be treated as a _Finesse_. (This is because it would be the same thing as cluing the 4 of a normal suit with a number 4 clue.)

### No 4 Saves

- In a reversed suit, a 4 is equivalent to a 2. Thus, it would seem natural to save them in a manner similar to 2s.
- However, in order to simplify things, we agree that a _4 Save_ would be illegal.
- Players should try to _Chop Move_ a reversed 4 if they can. If not, simply let it get discarded, and the team can just use the other copy.

### No Order Chop Moves

- At the beginning of the game, when you get a clue that touches multiple 1's, you are supposed to play them from right-to-left (in exactly in the same way that you would in a no variant game).
- Players are not allowed to _Order Chop Move_, because they could be misplaying a reversed card.
  - The exception is when the reversed 1 is visible.

### The 2 Double Bluff

- Similar to the _4 Double Bluff_, you can also use a reversed 2 to initiate a _2 Double Bluff_ in exactly the same way.

### The 1 Double Bluff

- Similar to the _5 Double Bluff_, you can also use a reversed 1 to initiate a _1 Double Bluff_ in exactly the same way.

### 1 Color Ejection (1CE)

- Similar to _5 Color Ejection_, it is also possible to perform a _1 Color Ejection_ on a reversed suit.
- _1 Color Ejection_ works in the exact same way that _5 Color Ejection_ does (e.g. players use the "two-or-more blind-plays" rule).

### 2 Charm

- Similar to _4 Charm_, it is also possible to perform a _2 Charm_ in an _Up or Down_ variant.
- _2 Charms_ works in the exact same way that _4 Charms do_ (e.g. players use the "three-or-more blind-plays" rule).

### 1's Chop Move

- Normally, when someone gives a number 1 clue, and all the 1's are played on the stacks, it communicates a _Trash Chop Move_.
- In a variant with a reversed suit, we agree that players can also perform this move by using a reversed 1, as a _1's Chop Move_ (which is similar to a _5's Chop Move)_.
- In this situation, the player who receives the clue should _Chop Move_ their cards to the right of the 1 and also keep the 1 as a (potential) reversed 1.
  - If they happen to see the real copy of the reversed 1 at a later point in the game, then they can discard the 1 as known-trash.
- If there are two or more cards are touched from _1's Chop Move_, the reversed 1 is promised on the right-most.

### The Turnabout Ejection (for 1s)

- [Turnabout Ejections](pink.mdx#the-turnabout-ejection) can be performed on a reversed 1 in the same way that they can on a pink 5.
- In other words:
  - if a reversed 1 is the focus of a number 1 clue that is a _Play Clue_,
  - and the next player would need to blind-play two or more cards to fulfill a _Finesse_,
  - then they would instead interpret the clue as a _Turnabout Ejection_ (similar to 1CE).
