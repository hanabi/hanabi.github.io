These conventions apply to any variant with a black (one of each) suit.

### Black 2 & Black 5 Saves

- Players should save black 2's and black 5's with a number clue instead of a color clue. (This helps narrow down what card is being clued.)
- There are four exceptions to this:
  - if the black clue touched two or more previously unclued black cards **or** critical Rainbow cards
  - if the black clue was required to avoid violating _Good Touch Principle_
  - if the black clue "filled in" an ancillary card
  - if the black clue gave important negative information to one or more cards in the hand
- Subsequently, if a black clue is used to touch a black 2 or a black 5 (and the above exceptions are not applicable), then it should be treated as a _Play Clue_ on the touched card.

### Black 3 & Black 4 Saves

- Players should save black 3's and black 4's with a color clue instead of a number clue. (This helps narrow down what card is being clued.)
- There is one exception to this:
  - if the number clue also touched another critical card (this is called a _Florrat Save_)
- Subsequently, if a number clue is used to touch a black 3 or a black 4 (and the above exception is not applicable), then it should be treated as a _Play Clue_ on the touched card.
