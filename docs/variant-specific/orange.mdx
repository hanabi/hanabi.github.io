These conventions apply to any variant with an orange (inverted) suit.

### The Orange Finesse / The Orange Double Finesse

- A _Finesse_ on orange cards causes blind-discards instead of blind-plays, in exactly the way you would expect.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues orange to Cathy, touching an orange 2 on slot 1 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob sees that he has been promised an orange 1 on his _Finesse Position_. Normally, in a _Finesse_, he would blind-play his _Finesse Position_, but since he is promised an orange card, he blind-discards his _Finesse Position_ instead. It is the orange 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Cathy knows that she has the orange 2 to match the blind-discard.
- This concept works identically for a _Double Finesse_.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues orange to Donald, touching an orange 3 on slot 1 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob blind-discards his _Finesse Position_. It is orange 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Cathy blind-discards her _Finesse Position_. It is orange 2 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Donald knows that he has the orange 3 to match the two blind-discards.

### The Non-Orange Rank Play Clue Assumption

- By default, _Play Clues_ with rank are assumed to be non-orange cards.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching three 1's as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that if he simply plays all of the 1's, he has a chance to discard an orange 1, which could be bad because then the team would lose their only visible copy. However, Bob also knows that rank play clues are assumed to be non-orange cards, so he does not have to worry about it.
  - Bob plays all of his 1's in the normal order.
- This convention is turned off when the only playable suit left is the orange suit.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks except for the orange 1.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching a 1 on slot 1 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob assumes that it is the orange 1 and discards it. It is an orange 1 and successfully plays on the stacks.

### The Orange Color Play Clue Assumption

- By default, _Play Clues_ with orange color are assumed to be orange cards.
- For example, in a 3-player game of "Rainbow & Orange (5 Suits)":
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues orange to Bob, touching a card on slot 1 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that the two playable orange cards are rainbow 1 and orange 1. That puts him in a potential dilemma, because guessing wrong will cause him to discard a card he intended to play.
  - However, Bob also knows that orange color play clues are assumed to be orange cards, which means that he can be confident that he has the orange 1 exactly.
  - Bob discards his orange card. It is orange 1 and successfully plays on the stacks.

### The Orange Fix Clue

- When an orange card is on chop, it must be indicated with a clue in order to prevent a strike.
  - The exception is when the card would "accidentally" play via discarding, which is covered in the next section. But this will rarely be the case.
- An orange 2 on chop must be fixed/saved with a _2 Save_, as per normal.
- An orange 5 must be fixed/saved with a _5 Save_, as per normal.
- An orange 3 and orange 4 must be fixed/saved with an orange color clue.
- Trash orange cards must also be fixed with an orange color clue.
- Thus, the note on a chop card after an _Orange Fix Clue_ would be:
  - `o3, o4` if there are no orange cards played.
  - `o3, o4, trash` if there are one or more orange cards played.

### Orange Fix Clues in The Early Game

- For the purposes of _The Early Game_, _Orange Fix Clues_ are considered to be "required" in the same way that saving a 5 on chop would be required.

### The Orange Accidental Blind-Play

- When a playable orange card is on chop, you should not indicate it with a clue. This is because the player will naturally discard it, which will cause it to "accidentally" play.

### The Orange Gentleman's Discard

- When an orange card is _Gentleman's Discarded_, instead of promising that the matching card is on _Finesse Position_, it is instead promised to be on chop.

### The Orange Baton Discard

- When an orange card is _Baton Discarded_, instead of promising that the matching card is on _Finesse Position_, it is instead promised to be on chop.

### The Orange Blaze Discard (Unchanged)

- When an orange card is played as a _Blaze Discard_, there are no special rules like there are with _Gentleman's Discard_ and _Baton Discard_. In other words, Bob should blind-play his _Second Finesse Position_ if he sees that the matching orange card is on _Second Finesse Position_.

### The Hollow Bluff

- Because all orange cards have to be clued when they get to chop, you can think of them as being like "land mines". Thus, if you can remove the land mine early, it is usually good to do so.
- One way to do this is to get them to blind-play by using a _Bluff_ (which will cause them to be discarded). However, since no cards are actually being blind-played, the _Bluff_ is "hollow".
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 3 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that this must be a _Finesse_, so he blind-plays his _Finesse Position_, trying to play a red 2. Instead, he discards an orange 1.
  - Cathy knows that since Bob tried to play his _Finesse Position_, she must have the _one-away-from-playable_ red card, the red 3.
- If the card discarded from a _Hollow Bluff_ is not trash, them all players should write _Elimination Notes_ for the other copy.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - The setup is identical to the previous example, but instead of blind-discarding an orange 1, Bob blind-discards an orange 3.
  - Like the previous example, Cathy knows that her red card is red 3. Furthermore, Cathy knows that someone must have the other copy of the orange 3. Cathy does not see the orange 3 in anyone else's hand, she marks her non-red cards as possible orange 3's.
- Since _Hollow Bluffs_ are useful to get rid of the "land mines", they should never cause a _Chop Move_.

### The Hollow [Whatever]

- Similar to how it is possible to get an orange card to blind-discard as a _Hollow Bluff_, you can also get an orange card to blind-discard as a _Hollow Unknown Trash Discharge_, a _Hollow Chop Move Ignition_, and so on.

### The Citrus Bluff

- First, see the section on the [_Hollow Bluff_](#the-hollow-bluff).
- Because of _Bob's Truth Principle_, you cannot normally use an orange card as a _Bluff_ target, since the reacting player would blind-discard instead of blind-play.
- However, you can use an orange card as a _Bluff_ target if the card on _Finesse Position_ is trash. This is similar to how a _Hollow Bluff_ works, but inverted.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues orange to Cathy, touching an orange 3 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that this must be a _Finesse_, so he blind-discards his _Finesse Position_, trying to play an orange 2. Instead, he blind-discards a red 1.
  - Cathy knows that since Bob tried to discard his _Finesse Position_, she must have the one-away-from-playable orange card, the orange 3.
- You can also perform a _Citrus Bluff_ on a non-trash card. Similar to a _Hollow Bluff_, this should cause all players to write Elimination Notes for the other copy.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - The setup is identical to the previous example.
  - Instead of blind-discarding a red 1, Bob blind-discards a red 3.
  - Like the previous example, Cathy knows that her orange card is orange 3. Furthermore, Cathy knows that someone must have the other copy of the red 3. Cathy does not see the red 3 in anyone else's hand, so she marks her non-orange cards as possible red 3's.

### The Defiant 3 Bluff

- Normally, if Alice clues an orange 3 with a number 3 _Play Clue_, then Bob would think he has the orange 1 and the orange 2 as a _Double Finesse_ (because of _Bob's Truth Principle_).
- However, we agree that number 3 clues to an orange 3 always call for a _Known Bluff_ on a non-orange card. (In other words, we agree to turn off _Bob's Truth Principle_ for this specific type of clue.)
- For example, in a 3-player game of "Orange (5 Suits)":
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks except for the red 1.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching an orange 3 on slot 1 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Normally, Bob would think that this is a _Finesse_ on orange 2 into orange 3. However, he also knows that because the _Defiant 3 Bluff_ convention exists, he should treat it as a _Known Bluff_ instead.
  - Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_. It is a red 1 was successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Cathy knows that:
    - If Alice's clue was a normal _Bluff_, she would have the yellow 3, the green 3, the blue 3.
    - If Alice's clue was a _3 Bluff_, she would have the red 3.
    - If Alice's clue was a _Defiant 3 Bluff_, she would have the orange 3.
  - Thus, Cathy knows that her 3 can be any suit.

### Ejections & Discharges & Charms on Orange Cards

- Orange cards can be used as targets for _Ejections_ and _Discharges_ and _Charms_. However, the blind-playing player should always blind-play instead of blind-discard.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues orange to Cathy, touching an orange 5 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that this is a _5 Color Ejection_. But should he blind-play or blind-discard his _Second Finesse Position_?
  - Bob knows that _Ejections_ & _Discharges_ & _Charms_ on orange cards call for blind-plays, so Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_. It is a red 1 and successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Cathy marks her orange card as exactly orange 5.

### Complicated Moves on Orange Cards are Necessary

- If a complicated move gets an orange card blind-discarded / blind-played / touched, then it is considered to be necessary.
  - This is because if the orange card got to chop, a clue would have to be "wasted" to prevent it from bombing.

### Elimination with Orange Cards

- The _Elimination Blind Play Riding Deduction_ does not apply when the _Elimination Notes_ are on an immediately playable orange card. This is because the team's plan might be to cause an _Orange Accidental Blind-Play_.

### The Orange Trash Discharge

- In rare cases, it is possible to misrepresent an orange trash card as a non-orange trash card. Since playing from _Finesse Position_ and _Second Finesse Position_ would not resolve the misrepresentation, we agree to play _Third Finesse Position_ instead.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1s are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching an orange 1 on slot 4.
  - Bob sees that from Cathy's perspective, this will look like a _Trash Chop Move_:
    - If Bob does nothing, Cathy will go on to discard the orange 1, causing a misplay.
    - If Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_, Cathy will think a _Chop Move Ignition_ is happening and will misplay her slot 5 card.
    - If Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_, Cathy will think a _Bad Chop Move Ejection_ is happening, and she will still go on to discard the orange 1, causing a misplay.
    - Thus, Bob blind-plays his _Third Finesse Position_. It is a red 2 and successfully plays on the stacks.
    - Cathy marks her card as orange 1, since that is the only way that this type of clue would cause a _Discharge_.
- If an _Orange Trash Discharge_ touches two or more trash cards, then only the focus is promised to be an orange card. The leftmost trash card is considered to be focused, since that is the card that would be discarded first.
