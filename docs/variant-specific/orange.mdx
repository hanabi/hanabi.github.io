These conventions apply to any variant with an orange (inverted) suit.

### The Orange Fix Clue

- When an orange card is on chop, it must be indicated with a clue in order to prevent a strike.
  - The exception is when the card would "accidentally" play via discarding, which is covered in the next section. But this will rarely be the case.
- An orange 2 on chop must be fixed/saved with a _2 Save_, as per normal.
- An orange 5 must be fixed/saved with a _5 Save_, as per normal.
- An orange 3 and orange 4 must be fixed/saved with an orange color clue.
- Trash orange cards must also be fixed with an orange color clue.
- Thus, the note on a chop card after an _Orange Fix Clue_ would be:
  - `o3, o4` if there are no orange cards played.
  - `o3, o4, trash` if there are one or more orange cards played.

### The Orange Accidental Blind-Play

- When a playable orange card is on chop, you should not indicate it with a clue. This is because the player will naturally discard it, which will cause it to "accidentally" play.

### The Hollow Bluff

- Because all orange cards have to be clued when they get to chop, you can think of them as being like "land mines". Thus, if you can remove the land mine early, it is usually good to do so.
- One way to do this is to get them to blind-play by using a _Bluff_ (which will cause them to be discarded). However, since no cards are actually being blind-played, the _Bluff_ is "hollow".
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 3 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that this must be a _Finesse_, so he blind-plays his _Finesse Position_, trying to play a red 2. Instead, he discards an orange 1.
  - Cathy knows that since Bob tried to play his _Finesse Position_, she must have the _one-away-from-playable_ red card, the red 3.
- If the card discarded from a _Hollow Bluff_ is not trash, them all players should write _Elimination Notes_ for the other copy.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 3 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that this must be a _Finesse_, so he blind-plays his _Finesse Position_, trying to play a red 2. Instead, he discards an orange 3.
  - Cathy knows that since Bob tried to play his _Finesse Position_, she must have the _one-away-from-playable_ red card, the red 3. Furthermore, Cathy knows that someone must have the other copy of the orange 3. Cathy does not see the orange 3 in anyone else's hand, she marks her non-red cards as possible orange 3's.
- Since _Hollow Bluffs_ are useful to get rid of the "land mines", they should never cause a _Chop Move_.

### The Orangeman Discard

- When an orange card is _Gentleman's Discarded_, instead of promising that the matching card is on _Finesse Position_, it is instead promised to be on chop.
- This is called an _Orangeman Discard_ to distinguish it from the more ordinary kind.

### Complicated Moves on Orange Cards are Necessary

- If a complicated move gets an orange card blind-played or touched in some way, then it is considered to be necessary.
  - This is because if the orange card got to chop, a clue would have to be "wasted" to prevent it from bombing.
