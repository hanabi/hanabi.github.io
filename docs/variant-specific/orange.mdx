These conventions apply to any variant with an orange (inverted) suit.

### The Orange Fix Clue

- When an orange card is on chop, it must be indicated with a clue in order to prevent a strike.
  - The exception is when the card would "accidentally" play via discarding. But this will rarely be the case.
- An orange 2 on chop must be fixed/saved with a _2 Save_, as per normal.
- An orange 5 must be fixed/saved with a _5 Save_, as per normal.
- An orange 3 and orange 4 must be fixed/saved with an orange color clue.
- Trash orange cards must also be fixed with an orange color clue.
- Thus, the note on a chop card after an _Orange Fix Clue_ would be:
  - `o3, o4` if there are no orange cards played.
  - `o3, o4, trash` if there are one or more orange cards played.

### The Orangeman Discard

- When an orange card is _Gentleman's Discarded_, instead of promising that the matching card is on _Finesse Position_, it is instead promised to be on chop.

### Complicated Moves on Orange Cards are Necessary

- If a complicated move gets an orange card blind-played or touched in some way, then it is considered to be necessary.
  - This is because if the orange card got to chop, a clue would have to be "wasted" to prevent it from bombing.
