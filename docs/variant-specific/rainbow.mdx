These conventions apply to any variant with a rainbow (touched by all colors) or dual-color suit.

### Saving Rainbow Cards

- If a rainbow 2 has not yet been discarded, then it must be _2 Saved_ in the same way that normal 2's are.
- If a rainbow 2, a rainbow 3, or a rainbow 4 are critical, then they can be saved with any color or the respective rank.
- Thus, as soon as a rainbow 2, a rainbow 3, or a rainbow 4 become critical, any color clue to a chop card will probably just look like a _Save Clue_ on a critical card.

### Free Choice

- _Free Choice_ is defined as when a player has two or more options to clue a card and all of the options would **only** touch the same card(s).
- For example, in a no variant game:
  - Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: `red 1, blue 4, blue 4, yellow 4, yellow 4`
  - If Alice wants to give a _Play Clue_ to the red 1, Alice is said to have a _Free Choice_ between red and number 1, since both of those clue types would **only** touch the red 1.
- Since rainbow cards are touched by any color, players will often have a _Free Choice_ on how to clue a rainbow card.
- For example, in a rainbow game with 6 suits:
  - Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: `rainbow 1, blue 4, yellow 4, green 4, yellow 4`
  - If Alice wants to give a _Play Clue_ to the rainbow 1, Alice is said to have a _Free Choice_ between red, purple, and number 1, since all of those clue types would **only** touch the rainbow 1.

### The Free Choice Finesse

- When performing a _Prompt_ on a rainbow card, if the cluer chooses a color that only touches rainbow cards **and** they have a _Free Choice_ to choose the color that matches the color on the clued rainbow card, then **they must always choose the color that matches**.
- For example, in a rainbow game:
  - The red 1 is played on the stack.
  - Bob has a clued red card in his hand. He does not know the identity of the card.
  - Cathy has no clued cards in her hand, and her hand is, from newest to oldest: `yellow 2, green 3, rainbow 2, yellow 5, green 4`.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching the rainbow 2.
  - Bob sees that Alice had a _Free Choice_ between blue and red, which would both only touch the rainbow 2, and she chose the color that _matches_ Bob's clued card.
  - Bob therefore knows that this is a _Free Choice Prompt_ and plays his slot 2 card as the rainbow 1.

- If a player in this situation chooses **not** choose to match the color, then they must be trying to communicate something extra. This signifies that it is actually a _Finesse_ instead of a _Prompt_.
- Modifying the example above:
  - Alice clues **blue** to Cathy instead, touching the rainbow 2.
  - Bob sees that Alice had a _Free Choice_ between blue and red, which would both only touch the rainbow 2, and she chose the color that does _not_ match Bob's clued card.
  - Bob therefore knows that this is a _Free Choice Finesse_ and plays his slot 1 card as the rainbow 1.

### The Free Choice Bluff

- It is possible to use the _Free Choice_ convention to communicate to a teammate that you want a _Finesse_ instead of a _Prompt_ in order to get them to play an unrelated playable card from their _Finesse Position_.
- Like a normal _Bluff_, after a _Free Choice Bluff_, the player who blind-played does not necessarily have the "connecting" card in their hand.
