These conventions apply to variants with **both** a black suit and a rainbow suit.

### Crazy 3 Saves & Crazy 4 Saves

- It is possible to violate _Good Touch Principle_ by cluing black to save a black 3 or a black 4, because there can be other useless rainbow cards in the hand.
- Thus, a second exception to the _Black 3 and Black 4 Saves_ convention is added:
  - if the number clue was required to avoid violating _Good Touch Principle_
