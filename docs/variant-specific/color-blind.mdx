These conventions apply to the "Color Blind" variants.

### Color Clues --> Slot Numbers

- Number clues mean the same thing as normal.
- All color clues have a special meaning:
  - Red means play slot 1 (because it is the 1st stack from the left).
  - Yellow means play slot 2 (because it is the 2nd stack from the left).
  - Green means play slot 3.
  - Blue means play slot 4.
  - Purple means play slot 5 (in a 2-player or 3-player game).
- Furthermore, all color clues have to be treated as potential _Delayed Play Clues_, _Prompts_, and _Reverse Finesses_.

### 4 Suit Exceptions

- There are not enough colors to get all of the slots for a 2-player or 3-player game with 4 suits, so players are simply not able to clue slot 5 with a color clue.

### 3 Suit Exceptions

- There are not enough colors to get all of the slots for a 2-player or 3-player game with 3 suits, so the color assignments are customized:
  - Red means play slot 2.
  - Green means play slot 3.
  - Blue means play slot 4.
- There are not enough colors to get all of the slots for a 4-player or 5-player game with 3 suits, so players are simply not able to clue slot 4 with a color clue.

### Extra Color --> Chop Move

- If there is an extra color that does not correspond to a slot (e.g. purple in a 4-player "Color Blind (5 Suits)" variant), then that is used to mean that the clue recipient should _Chop Move_ one card.

### 2nd Extra Color --> Double Finesse

- If there is a second extra color that does not correspond to a slot (e.g. teal in a 4-player "Color Blind (6 Suits)" variant), then that is used to mean that that two people should blind-play their _Finesse Position_.
- The two blind-plays do not necessarily have to be on two players in a row - they can be on anyone.
- The clue should always be given to the person who will perform the second blind-play.

### The Mismatch Finesse

- If a player has two of the same playable card in their hand, players are expected to give a positional _Play Clue_ to the left-most one.
- If a player instead gives a positional _Play Clue_ to the right-most one, then they are trying to communicate something extra.
- This means that the next player should blind-play their _Finesse Position_ as any unrelated playable card.
- _Mismatch Finesses_ can also rarely give a player a safe discard.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy has a red 1 in slot 1 and another red 1 in slot 2.
  - Alice clues green to Cathy, giving a _Play Clue_ to Cathy's slot 2.
  - Bob knows that since Cathy had a duplicate card on slot 1 and slot 2, Alice was supposed to get the left-most card, the slot 1.
  - Alice must be doing the _Mismatch Finesse_. Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_, and it is a blue 1.
  - Cathy assumes that Alice did a _Finesse_ - due to Bob's blind-play, she must have the blue 2 in her slot 2. Cathy plays her slot 2, and it is revealed to be red 1.
  - Cathy now knows that it was not a normal _Finesse_ at all - it was instead a _Mismatch Finesse_, because there is no other explanation for why Bob would blind-play from a _Play Clue_ on a red 1.
  - Cathy also knows that she must have another red 1 in her hand. Since there is only one card to the left of her slot 2, she knows that the red 1 has to be exactly in her slot 1 (at the time of the clue).
  - Due to this, when Cathy needs to discard next, she will blind-discard her slot 2 card (since slot 1 has now shifted down to slot 2 after she played the red 1).

### Advanced Conventions

- In Color Blind variants, _Ejections_ and _Discharges_ work quite differently. See the [Specific Conventions for Variants with No Positive Clues](no-positive-clues.mdx).
