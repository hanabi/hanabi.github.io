These conventions apply to any variant with a prism suit.

### Cathy's Connecting Principle in Prism

- For the purpose of _Finesses_ and _Bluffs_, prism cards only "connect" to the **next** direct color clue. (Rank clues connect normally.)
- Thus, it is possible for players to perform a [_Hard 3 Bluff_](level-13.mdx#the-hard-3-bluff) on a prism 1 by cluing color to prism 3.

### The Ambiguous Prism Tempo Clue

- Sometimes, players have a clued prism card in their hand that matches a clued normal card in their hand.
- For example, in a "Prism (5 Suits)" game:
  - Bob has a blue 4 and a prism 4 in his hand. Both have been previously clued with a blue color clue, but Bob does not know the true identity of either card.
- In this situation, it is hard to give a _Tempo Clue_ to the rightmost card. Thus, the _Ambiguous Tempo Clue_ convention applies, and we agree that:
  - a color _Tempo Clue_ should focus the rightmost card
  - a rank _Tempo Clue_ should focus the left most card

#### Interaction Between the Ambiguous Prism Tempo Clue and the Tempo Clue Chop Move

- _Ambiguous Prism Tempo Clues_ are considered to be high-value. Thus, we agree to never _Chop Move_ from these types of clues.
