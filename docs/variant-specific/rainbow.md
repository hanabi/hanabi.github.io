These conventions apply to any variant with a rainbow (touched by all colors) or dual-color suit.

### Saving Rainbow Cards

- If a rainbow 2 has not yet been discarded, then it must be _2 Saved_ in the same way that normal 2's are.
- If a rainbow 2, a rainbow 3, or a rainbow 4 are critical, then they can be saved with any color, or the respective rank.
- Thus, as soon as a rainbow 2, a rainbow 3, or a rainbow 4 become critical, any color clue to a chop card will probably just look like a _Save Clue_ on a critical card.

### Free Choice

- _Free Choice_ is defined as when a player has two or more options to clue a card and all of the options would **only** touch the same card(s).
- For example, in a no variant game:
  - Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: red 1, blue 4, blue 4, yellow 4, yellow 4
  - If Alice wants to give a _Play Clue_ to the red 1, Alice is said to have a _Free Choice_ between red and number 1, since both of those clue types would **only** touch the red 1.
- Since rainbow cards are touched by any color, players will often have a _Free Choice_ on how to clue a rainbow card.
- For example, in a rainbow game with 6 suits:
  - Bob hand is, from newest to oldest: rainbow 1, blue 4, yellow 4, green 4, yellow 4
  - If Alice wants to give a _Play Clue_ to the rainbow 1, Alice is said to have a _Free Choice_ between red, purple, and number 1, since all of those clue types would **only** touch the rainbow 1.

### The Free Choice Finesse

- When performing a _Prompt_ on a rainbow card, if the cluer chooses a color that only touches rainbow cards **and** they have a _Free Choice_ to choose the color that matches the color on the clued rainbow card, then **they should always choose the color that matches**.
- For example, in a rainbow game with 6 suits:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a clued rainbow 2 in his hand. It is clued with only red. He does not know the identity of the card.
  - Cathy has no clued cards in her hand. Cathy hand is, from newest to oldest: rainbow 3, blue 1, yellow 1, green 1, yellow 1
  - If Alice gives a _Play Clue_ to the rainbow 3, it would _Prompt_ the rainbow 2 in Bob's hand.
  - Alice needs to decide on what clue to give. She does not want to give blue, yellow, or green, since that would cause a _Bad Touch_ on the 1's that are already played.
  - That leaves red, purple, and number 3. Since all of these clues would **only** touch the rainbow 3, Alice is said to have a _Free Choice_ between those clue types.
  - So, the following things are true:
    1. Alice is doing a _Prompt_ by giving a clue that will only touch rainbow cards
    1. Alice has red available as a _Free Choice_ between two or more clue types
    1. Bob's rainbow 2 is clued red
  - Thus, Alice **must** choose red if she wants to prompt the rainbow 2.
- If a player in this situation chooses **not** choose to match the color, then they must be trying to communicate something extra. This signifies that it is actually a _Finesse_ instead of a _Prompt_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Bob red, which touches a red 1 in slot 1 and a red 3 in slot 2.
  - Bob plays red 1 from slot 1. He draws a rainbow 1, which is now in his slot 1.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Alice notices that Bob has a rainbow 1 in _Finesse Position_. And Cathy has a rainbow 2 in her hand.
  - Since _Prompts_ take precedence over _Finesses_, if Alice clues the rainbow 2 with red, then Bob will misplay the red 3 as rainbow 1. This is a problem.
  - However, Cathy has no red cards, no blue cards, and no other rainbow cards in her hand. Thus, if Alice wants to clue the rainbow 2 with a color, Alice has a _Free Choice_ between cluing red and cluing blue.
  - Alice clues blue to Cathy, which only touches the rainbow 2.
  - Bob knows that since Alice had a _Free Choice_ and did not color-match with red, he should play his slot 1 instead of his slot 2.

### The Free Choice Bluff

- It is possible to use the _Free Choice_ convention to communicate to a teammate that you want a _Finesse_ instead of a _Prompt_ in order to get them to play an unrelated playable card from their _Finesse Position_.
- Like a normal _Bluff_, after a _Free Choice Bluff_, the player who blind-played does not necessarily have the "connecting" card in their hand.
