These conventions apply to the "Clue Starved" variants.

### The Bomb Finesse

- This convention only applies to _Clue Starved_ variants.
- In these variants, giving a _Fix Clue_ is not worth it if the team has less than 2 strikes and only one misplay will happen (on a non-critical card).
- Following from this, if a _Layered Finesse_ with a _Lie Component_ is needed, it is better to **not** give the _Fix Clue_ and just let them get the strike.
- Players who get a strike in this way would normally stop playing into the _Finesse_, knowing that something has gone wrong. But in _Clue Starved_, they should keep going, knowing that the strike (bomb) was intentional.
