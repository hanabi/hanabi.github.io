title: Critical Fours

These conventions apply to any variant with critical fours.

### The 4 Save

- Players must save 4's with a number clue. (This is analogous to the _5 Save_.)

### Special Suit Cases

- In variants with a special suit, the four of that special suit is instead saved according to the conventions governing that special suit.
