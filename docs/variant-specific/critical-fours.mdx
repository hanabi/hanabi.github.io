---

These conventions apply to any variant with critical fours.

<br />

### The 4 Save

- Players must save fours with a number clue. (This is analogous to _5 Saves_.)
- Consequently, color clues that focus a 4 are never _Save Clues_. (They are also never _Double Bluffs_ or _4 Charms_.)

### Corner cases

In general, in a combination of critical fours and a special suit, the four of that special suit is saved according to the conventions governing that special suit.

- **Dark Omni & Gray Pink**: Dark Omni/Gray Pink 4 is saved with a 5 number clue.
- **Black**: Black 4 is saved with black.
- **Brown**: Brown 4 is saved with brown.
- **Dark Pink\***: Dark Pink 4 is saved with pink.
- **Muddy Rainbow & Cocoa Rainbow**: Rainbow 4 is saved with red.
