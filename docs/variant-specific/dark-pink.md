These conventions apply to any variant with a dark pink (touched by all ranks and one of each) suit.

<br />

### Black Conventions & Pink Conventions

- Dark Pink "inherits" all of the conventions for black cards and all of the conventions for pink cards.
- Some specific clarifications and exceptions are listed below.

<br />

### Save Clues

- Just like a black suit, dark pink 3 and dark pink 4 are saved with a pink color clue.

<br />

### Dark Pink Tempo Clues

- Normally, *Tempo Clues* on pink cards would never cause a *Tempo Clue Chop Move* (because *Tempo* on pink cards is important).
- However, this does not apply to dark pink cards. *Tempo Clues* on dark pink cards work as they normally do. (Meaning that it is possible to perform a *Tempo Clue Chop Move* by giving a *Tempo Clue* to a dark pink card, provided that all of the other normal *Tempo Clue Chop Move* conditions are met.)

<br />

### The Fake 5's Chop Move

- Players are allowed to violate *Pink Promise* on dark pink cards in order to perform a *Fake 5's Chop Move*.
- This means that *Pink Promise* no longer applies to off-chop cards when they are clued as a 5, unless it was just a *5 Stall*.

<br />

### The Fake 5 Pull & The Fake 5 Number Discharge

- Similar to the *[Fake 5's Chop Move](#the-fake-5s-chop-move)&, players can also violate *Pink Promise* in order to initiate a *5 Pull* or a *5 Number Discharge*.
- Sometimes, when a *5 Pull* is occurring, it can be ambiguous to other players on the team as to whether a *5 Pull* or a *5 Stall* is happening. However, when a *Fake 5 Pull* (or a *Fake 5 Number Discharge*) is happening, everyone can be sure that it is a *5 Pull*, because it would be illegal to violate *Pink Promise* when performing a *5 Stall*.
