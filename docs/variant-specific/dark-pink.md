These conventions apply to any variant with a dark pink (touched by all ranks and one of each) suit.

<br />

### Black Conventions & Pink Conventions

- Dark Pink "inherits" all of the conventions for black cards and all of the conventions for pink cards.
- Some specific clarifications and exceptions are listed below.

<br />

### Save Clues

- Just like a black suit, dark pink 3 and dark pink 4 are saved with a pink color clue.

<br />

### Dark Pink Tempo Clues

- Normally, _Tempo Clues_ on pink cards would never cause a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_ (because _Tempo_ on pink cards is important).
- However, this does not apply to dark pink cards. _Tempo Clues_ on dark pink cards work as they normally do. (Meaning that it is possible to perform a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_ by giving a _Tempo Clue_ to a dark pink card, provided that all of the other normal _Tempo Clue Chop Move_ conditions are met.)

<br />

### The Fake 5's Chop Move

- Players are allowed to violate _Pink Promise_ on dark pink cards in order to perform a _Fake 5's Chop Move_.
- This means that _Pink Promise_ no longer applies to off chop cards when they are clued as a 5, unless it was just a _5 Stall_.

<br />

### The Fake 5 Pull & The Fake 5 Number Discharge

- Similar to the *[Fake 5's Chop Move](#the-fake-5s-chop-move)&, players can also violate *Pink Promise* in order to initiate a *5 Pull* or a *5 Number Discharge\*.
- Sometimes, when a _5 Pull_ is occurring, it can be ambiguous to other players on the team as to whether a _5 Pull_ or a _5 Stall_ is happening. However, when a _Fake 5 Pull_ (or a _Fake 5 Number Discharge_) is happening, everyone can be sure that it is a _5 Pull_, because it would be illegal to violate _Pink Promise_ when performing a _5 Stall_.
