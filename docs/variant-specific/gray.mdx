These conventions apply to any variant with a gray (colorless and one-of-each) suit.

<br />

### White Conventions

- All white conventions also apply to gray cards.

### Gray 2 and Gray 5 Saves

- Just like any other suit, players should use the _2 Save_ convention and the _5 Save_ convention to save the gray 2 and the gray 5.
- Note that normally, the *Always Loaded Principle* applies to white cards, but we agree that it does not apply to the gray 2 / gray 5 when they are saved with a _2 Save_ or a _5 Save_, respectively. (This is because the value of giving tempo to a dark card is not as important as being able to save 2's or 5's in the early game or in stalling situations.)

### Gray 3 and Gray 4 Saves

- Obviously, players must use number 3 and number 4 to save the gray 3 and the gray 4, respectively.
- Thus, players have to remember that any number 3 or number 4 clue to their chop could be a save on the gray 3 or the gray 4.
- Additionally, according to the _Always Loaded Principle_, save clues with number 3 or number 4 are always _Loaded_.
