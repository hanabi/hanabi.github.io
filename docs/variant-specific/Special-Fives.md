# Specific Conventions for Special-Fives

These conventions apply to the "Special-Fives" variants (e.g. "Pink-Fives").

### Special 5 Saves

- This convention only applies to any variant where it is not possible to clue number 5.
- Since 5's cannot be *5 Saved*, a number 2 clue must be used to save them as a pseudo-*2 Save*.
