These conventions apply to variants with pink-ones.

### Play Clues on 1's with Number 2, Number 3, or Number 4

- In this variant, it is not possible to clue number 1 to a player.
- Thus, players will usually give a _Play Clue_ to a 1 with a color clue.
- Alternatively, a player can also give a _Play Clue_ to a 1 with a number 2 clue, a number 3 clue, or a number 4 clue.
- In this situation, the player knows to play the focused card and to hold on to the rest of the cards for later.
- This interpretation only applies if it is not possible to be a _Finesse_. (_Self-Finesses_ don't count.)
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching two 3's on slot 1 + slot 2 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob sees that Cathy does not have a playable card on her _Finesse Position_. (If she did, then Bob would need to wait to see what Cathy does.)
  - Bob knows that this is just a _Play Clue_ on a 1. Bob plays his slot 1 card. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Bob knows that his slot 2 card can either be another good 1 or a 3.

### Prompting 1's

- In this variant, it is possible to have 1's in a player's hand that are "misranked".
- _Finesses_ in this variant work the same as in a regular pink variabnt: play _Finesse Position_ instead of a potentially misranked 1.
