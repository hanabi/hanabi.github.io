### Null 4 Tech

- In this variant, it is not possible to clue the number 5 to take advantage of the *Null* conventions.
- The usual *Null* conventions apply, but with all number 5 clue conventions replaced with number 4 clues.
- The *Loaded 5 Tech Clue* instead means that when Bob is loaded and a previously unclued 4 is clued with a number 4 clue, the default conventional interpretation applies.
