### Null 4 Tech

- In this variant, it is not possible to clue number 5 to take advantage of the null conventions.
- The usual null conventions apply, but with all number 5 clue conventions replaced with number 4 clues.
- The "Loaded 5 Tech Clue" instead means that when Bob is loaded and a previously unclued 4 is clued with a number 4 clue, a default *Play Clue*, *Bluff*, *Double Bluff*, *4 Charm* etc. interpretation applies.
