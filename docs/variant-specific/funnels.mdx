These following changes to the standard conventions apply to the Funnels variants.

<br /> 

### 5 Clues

- Since 5 Clues touch all cards, a 5 Clue indicates a save on just the focused card on chop and all other newly touched cards are treated as unclued (Marked as X)
- In Brown variants, a 5 Clue that reveals a brown card on chop by empathy (that could otherwise be saved with a color clue) indicates a double chop move

<br /> 

### 4 Clues

- The receiver of a 4 Clue should chop move their last card and play their finesse position. All other newly touched cards are treated as unclued (Marked as X)

<br /> 

### 3 Clues

- The receiver of a 3 Clue should play their finesse position. All other newly touched cards are treated as unclued (Marked as X)
