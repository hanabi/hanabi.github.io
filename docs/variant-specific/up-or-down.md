These conventions apply to the "Up or Down" variants.

<br />

### Basic Conventions

- At the beginning of the game, number 5's is a play clue (similar to a number 1's clue).
- If there are any stacks going up, a number 5 clue to a chop card is to be treated as a normal _5 Save_.
- If there are any stacks going down, a number 1 clue to a chop card is to be treated as a _1 Save_.

### Disabled Conventions

- The _2 Saves_ convention is turned off. (2's are not valuable in this variant.)
- The _3 Bluffs_ convention is turned off. (3's are not valuable in this variant.)
- The _5 Stall_, _5's Chop Move_, and _5 Pull_ conventions are turned off.

### 1 Color Ejection (1CE)

- Similar to _5 Color Ejection_, it is also possible to perform a _1 Color Ejection_ in an _Up or Down_ variant.
- _1 Color Ejection_ works in the exact same way that _5 Color Ejection_ does (e.g. players use the "two-or-more blind-plays" rule).
- Before a _1 Color Ejection_ can be performed, the suit direction must be established. For example, if no cards are played on the stacks, then a _Play Clue_ touching a 1 would just look like a normal _Play Clue_.

### 2 Charm

- Similar to _4 Charm_, it is also possible to perform a _2 Charm_ in an _Up or Down_ variant.
- _2 Charms_ works in the exact same way that _4 Charms do_ (e.g. players use the "three-or-more blind-plays" rule).
- Before a _2 Charm_ can be performed, the suit direction must be established. For example, if no cards are played on the stacks, then a _Play Clue_ to a 2 would just indicate a normal _Finesse_.

### The U-Turn Finesse

- Normally, when a clued card is going to play and then someone on the team clues that card **again**, this is usually one of two different things:
  - a _Fix Clue_ - the receiver of the clue know that the card that they were going to play is actually bad, so now they will discard it instead.
  - a _Double-Play Ejection_ - an advanced move that causes the next player to blind-play their _Second Finesse Position_ card, immediately revealing what the point of the clue was.
- In the _Up or Down_ variants, both of these conventions are "turned off" in favor of a third interpretation - a _Finesse_ on the playable card, but going in the opposite direction.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Alice clues Cathy red, touching a red 5 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob clues Cathy red, re-touching the red 5.
  - Alice knows that re-touching the red 5 again accomplishes nothing unless it is some sort of _Finesse_. She looks around the table and does not see any red cards. Thus, Alice marks her hand for red 1, red 2, red 3, and red 4, in order from left to right.
