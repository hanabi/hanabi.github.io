These conventions apply to the "Up or Down" variants.

<br />

### Basic Conventions

- At the beginning of the game, number 5's is a play clue (similar to a number 1's clue).
- If there are any stacks going up, a number 5 clue to a chop card is to be treated as a normal *5 Save*.
- If there are any stacks going down, a number 1 clue to a chop card is to be treated as a *1 Save*.

### Disabled Conventions

- The *2 Saves* convention is turned off. (2's are not valuable in this variant.)
- The *3 Bluffs* convention is turned off. (3's are not valuable in this variant.)
- The *5 Stall*, *5's Chop Move*, and *5 Pull* conventions are turned off.

### 1 Color Ejection (1CE)

- Similar to *5 Color Ejection*, it is also possible to perform a *1 Color Ejection* in an *Up or Down* variant.
- *1 Color Ejection* works in the exact same way that *5 Color Ejection* does (e.g. players use the "two-or-more blind-plays" rule).
- Before a *1 Color Ejection* can be performed, the suit direction must be established. For example, if no cards are played on the stacks, then a *Play Clue* touching a 1 would just look like a normal *Play Clue*.

### 2 Charm

- Similar to *4 Charm*, it is also possible to perform a *2 Charm* in an *Up or Down* variant.
- *2 Charms* works in the exact same way that *4 Charms do* (e.g. players use the "three-or-more blind-plays" rule).
- Before a *2 Charm* can be performed, the suit direction must be established. For example, if no cards are played on the stacks, then a *Play Clue* to a 2 would just indicate a normal *Finesse*.

### The U-Turn Finesse

- Normally, when a clued card is going to play and then someone on the team clues that card **again**, this is usually one of two different things:
  - a *Fix Clue* - the receiver of the clue know that the card that they were going to play is actually bad, so now they will discard it instead.
  - a *Double-Play Ejection* - an advanced move that causes the next player to blind-play their *Second Finesse Position* card, immediately revealing what the point of the clue was.
- In the *Up or Down* variants, both of these conventions are "turned off" in favor of a third interpretation - a *Finesse* on the playable card, but going in the opposite direction.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Alice clues Cathy red, touching a red 5 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob clues Cathy red, re-touching the red 5.
  - Alice knows that re-touching the red 5 again accomplishes nothing unless it is some sort of *Finesse*. She looks around the table and does not see any red cards. Thus, Alice marks her hand for red 1, red 2, red 3, and red 4, in order from left to right.
