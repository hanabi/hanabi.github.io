These conventions apply to the "Dual-Color (6 Suits)" variant.

### The Negative Prompt

- In this variant, since negative color information conveys just as much information as positive color information, you should include that when deciding which card to play into a _Prompt_.
- For example:
  - Alice has a red card in slot 1 and a red card in slot 2.
  - Alice is _Prompted_ for a mahogany 2. (Mahogany is composed of red and black.)
  - Normally, Alice would play slot 1, since _Prompts_ promise the left-most card.
  - However, Alice's slot 1 card has no negative clues, and her slot 2 card has a negative yellow clue.
  - Thus, this is a _Negative Prompt_ and Alice plays slot 2 instead of slot 1.

### Order Chop Move Change

- Normally, _Order Chop Moves_, are "turned off" when two different 1's have different positive clues on them.
  - For example, Order Chop Moves would be "turned off" in the situation where Alice has one 1 has a positive 1 clue on it, and Alice has another 1 with a positive 1 clue on it and a positive red clue on it.
- In the "Dual Color (6 Suit)" variant, _Order Chop Moves_ are never turned off when there are two different 1's, regardless of different positive or negative color clues on them.
- The only exception is when the exact identity of the 1 is known (e.g. from being completely "filled in"). In this situation, _Order Chop Moves_ are turned off.
