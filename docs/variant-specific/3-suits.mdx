These conventions apply to any variant with only 3 suits.

<br />

### No 3 Bluffs

- The _3 Bluff_ convention is "turned off". (This is because _Double Finesses_ are much more likely in these variants.)

### The Full Finesse

- The following conventions are "turned off":
  - _5 Stall_
  - _5's Chop Move_
  - _5 Pull_
  - _5 Color Ejection_
  - _5 Number Ejection_
  - _5 Number Discharge_
- If a 5 is clued, then it is to be treated as a _Finesse_ on the full suit from 1 to 5.
