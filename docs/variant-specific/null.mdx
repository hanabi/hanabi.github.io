These conventions apply to any variant with a null (touched by no clues) suit. They are turned off once all null cards are played or globally known.

<br />

### The Null Ignition Kick

- When null cards are newly drawn, they can usually be gotten by bluffs, ejections and discharges. However, it can sometimes be difficult to get cards near the back of the player's hand.
- Therefore, in variants with a null suit, we replace less commonly used ejections with a null ignition kick. Specifically, _Replay Ejections_, _Poke Ejections_, _Trash Ejections_ and _Double Ejections_ are turned off, and instead signal a _Null Ignition Kick_.
- When Alice clues a _Null Ignition Kick_, Bob should immediately play his chop (he should not attempt to play chop moved cards from this).
- This convention applies only to Bob, and Null Finesses are explicitly illegal.
- Note that a _Double Ignition_ takes precedence over a _Null Ignition Kick_; if Bob sees that someone else has a playable card on finesse position, that interpretation should be preferred.

<br />

### Null 5 Tech

- The main tool to get null cards is to use number 5 clues. When Alice gives a number 5 clue, all players must pay careful attention to whether Bob was loaded on that turn.
- The _5 Save_ and _5's Chop Move_ are still on, but play clues with 5 (including on a previously clued 5), the _5 Pull_, and the _5 Number Discharge_ are usually turned off.

#### No 5 Stalls

- Except on the very first turn of the game (if there is nothing else to do), players in stalling situations may not clue the number 5, excepting the conventions below; in particular, _5 Stalls_ are disallowed in stalling situations, even in easy variants.
- This is because stalling situations very frequently overlap with situations where a null card must be saved.

#### The Null 5 Chop Move

- When Alice gives a number 5 clue that is not a _5 Save_ nor a _5's Chop Move_, **if Bob is not loaded**, this signals a _Null 5 Chop Move_ on Bob.
- This may be done only to save null cards, and only if they are critical or are a null 2 which is not available on any other player's non-chop (just like with ordinary _2 Saves_.
- This convention applies only to Bob; see _The Double Save_ for saving other players.

#### The Loaded 5 Null Play Clue

- When Alice gives a number 5 clue that is not a _5 Save_ nor a _5's Chop Move_, **if Bob is loaded**, this signals a _Loaded 5 Null Play Clue_ to Bob.
- Bob should immediately play his rightmost card with no positive clues; notably, if Bob is _Chop Moved_, he should play his rightmost _Chop Moved_ card.
- This convention applies only to Bob, and Null Finesses are explicitly illegal.
- Note that play clues with a number clue to a previously clued 5 are always off.

#### Interaction With Pink

- _Pink Promise_ does not apply to number 5 clues, except for _5 Saves_, _5's Chop Moves_, and _Turnabout Ejections_.
- In particular, it is not possible to perform a _Bubblegum Finesse_ or a _Bubblegum Bluff_ with a number 5 clue, except as a _Loaded 5 Tech Clue_.

<br />

### Saving Multiple Cards

#### Double Save Situations

- Sometimes, a player will have multiple cards on chop that need to be saved. In this case, the team will cooperate and use multiple clues to save all of the required cards.
- Given that the above conventions apply only to Bob, it can be difficult to save null cards on chop and then immediately to save further critical cards.
- A _Double Save Situation_ occurs when:
  1. Cathy is not loaded.
  2. Cathy has a critical null card on her _Chop_.
  3. The previous unclued card (Cathy's next chop after a save) is a critical card.
  4. Cathy's critical cards cannot all be saved cleanly with one clue, e.g. a _5 Chop Move_, a _Trash Chop Move_, or an _Unnecessary Reverse Trash Finesse_.

#### The Double Save

- The _Double Save_ allows for Alice and Bob to give two consecutive save clues to Cathy. This may be done only in a _Double Save Situation_.
- Alice may give a 5 clue, similar to a _Null 5 Chop Move_.
- In a Double Save Situation, Bob **must** immediately give another save clue to Cathy, and he should not mark a _Null 5 Chop Move_ on himself.
- When a _Double Save_ interpretation is possible, Cathy should always assume that a _Double Save_ has occurred; she should not assume that Alice performed a _Null 5 Chop Move_ on Bob and that Bob gave her a play clue.
- Since the necessity of saving 2s is not symmetric and can depend on Alice's and Bob's hands, _Double Saves_ may not be initiated to save non-critical 2s.
- Note that _Double Saves_ may be performed regardless of whether Bob is loaded.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (5 Suits)" variant:
  - The red 3 is played on the stacks.
  - Bob has already been clued about his yellow 1, and has a playable null 1 in as his rightmost card.
  - Cathy has two critical cards on chop: the null 5 and the green 4.
  - To save these cards, Alice can clue a number 5 clue to Cathy, making Bob clue a number 4 clue to Cathy.
  - Even if Bob is loaded, since this is a _Double Save Situation_, Bob should not consider this a _Loaded 5 Null Play Clue_, and he must save Cathy's green 4.
  - Upon receiving these clues, Cathy might consider that the number 5 clue was intended to get the null 1 and that she has been clued a playable red 4. However, if the clues leading up to her turn may have been a _Double Save_, she should always respect this possibility.
  - Cathy chop moves the null 5 and will discard the green 2 next; she should feel free to get other copies of the null 1.

#### The Double Save Corollary

- Since Cathy should always assume a _Double Save_ occurred whenever it is possible, Alice must take care not to create ambiguous situations by performing a _Null 5 Chop Move_ at the wrong time.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (5 Suits)" variant:
  - The red, yellow, green, and blue twos are all played on the stacks. 
  - Bob and Cathy both have critical null cards on chop.
  - Alice should refrain from giving a number 5 clue to Cathy as a _Null 5 Chop Move_ on Bob's null 2.
  - This is because doing so prevents Bob from saving Cathy's null 5; any attempt to do so would look like a double save, causing Cathy to chop move trash.
  - Alice should either clue number 1 to Bob as a _Trash Chop Move_ or discard and count on Bob to save the null 5.
<BadDoubleSave1 />
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (5 Suits)" variant:
  - The red, yellow, and blue ones are all played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a critical null card on chop, and Cathy has a playable yellow 2 near chop.
  - If Alice clues number 5 to Bob as a _Null 5 Chop Move_, Bob will be unable to get the yellow 2 to play.
  - This is because if Bob were to clue yellow to Cathy, it would look like a double save on the null 3 and yellow 4.
  - To avoid losing one or both threes, Alice should strongly consider doing something else, such as cluing the green 1 or discarding.

### Relaxed 1 and 2 Saves

- It is optional for players to give _Save Clues_ to null 2's.
- Thus, if a null 2 is discarded, players should not make any _Elimination Notes_ for it.
- Similarly, it is optional to play the first copy of the null 1.
- If the first copy of the null 1 was difficult to get played and is discarded, players should not make any _Elimination Notes_ for it.
