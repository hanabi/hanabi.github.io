These conventions apply to any variant with a null (touched by no clues) suit.

<br />

### Hard Variant

- Any variant with a null suit is treated as a _Hard Variant_, meaning that _Loaded Play Clues_ are "turned on" and so forth.

<br />

### Positional Clues

Since null cards cannot be clued directly, we agree that we should use _Positional Clues_ to "get" them.

#### 1) What is a _Positional Clue_?

- _Positional Clues_ correspond to a slot number.
- A **number** positional clue corresponds directly to the slot number.
  - For example, a number 3 clue equals slot 3.
  - In a 4-player, 5-player game, or 6-player game a number 5 clue equals _Chop Move_ (since there is no slot 5 card).
- A **color** positional clue corresponds to a slot number that is based on the order of the stacks. Stacks correspond to the slot numbers **from right to left**.
  - For example, in a 3-player game of the _Null (6 Suit)_ variant, there are 5 color clues and 5 slots in the hand. Thus, a purple clue equals slot 5 (since it is the right-most color), a blue clue equals slot 4 (since it is the 2nd right-most color), and so forth.
  - More examples for _Color Positional Clues_ are listed below in a separate section. (_Color Positional Clues_ have a dedicated section since they are a bit more complicated.)

#### 2) How do you perform a _Positional Clue_?

- Any "nonsense" clue (e.g. a clue that has no normal conventional interpretation) is to be interpreted as a _Positional Clue_ instead.
- Furthermore, in order to make it easier to perform _Positional Clues_, we also "turn off" the following conventions:
  - _Double Finesses_ or _Triple Finesses_ where the very next player has to blind-play **two or more** cards
  - _Double Bluffs_ or _Triple Bluffs_
  - _Ejections_
  - _Discharges_
  - _Charms_
  - _Ignitions_
  - _Self Color Bluffs_
  - _5 Pulls_
  - _Trash Pulls_
  - _Trash Pushes_
  - _Critical Color Bluffs_
  - _Finesses_ and _Bluffs_ that were initiated with a rank clue when a **_Free Choice_** was available between rank and color
- Any clue that looks like one of these conventions is to be interpreted as a _Positional Clue_ instead:

#### 3) Are _Positional Clues_ a _Save Clue_ or a _Play Clue_?

- A _Positional Clue_ can be either a _Save Clue_ or a _Play Clue_:
  - If the slot corresponds to the chop of a player, then they have to respect that it could be a _Save Clue_. In other words, it could be a _2 Save_ on a null 2, a _5 Save_ on a null 5, or a save on a critical null 3 or null 4 (if the other copy is in the trash).
  - If the slot corresponds to a slot that is not on the chop, then it is a _Play Clue_.
  - However, _Loaded Play Clues_ **always** apply to _Positional Clues_, even in the _Early Game_. (This means that you cannot ever give a _Positional Save Clue_ to a player that has one or more known-playable cards.)

#### 4) What about if all the Null cards are already played?

- _Positional Clues_ are "turned off" once all of the null cards have been played. Once that happens, _Double Finesses_, _Ejections_, and so forth are turned back on.

#### 5) Do I discard cards touched as a _Positional Clue_?

- _Good Touch Principle_ applies to cards touched with a _Positional Clue_ in the same way that normal clues are.
- Thus, if a trash card is used as part of a _Positional Clue_, then a _Fix Clue_ must be given to the trash card later on.

#### 6) How about an example?

- For example, in a 3-player null game:
  - On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy about one 4.
  - Bob knows that normally, this would be a _4's Double Bluff_. But _Double Bluffs_ are turned off in variants with a null suit.
  - Bob instead knows that this is a _Positional Clue_, indicating that someone should play their slot 4 card.
  - Bob sees that Cathy's slot 4 card is not a null card, so he plays his slot 4 card as the null 1.

#### 7) Do you have to be in _Bluff Seat_ to give a _Positional Clue_?

- Yes. You are only allowed to give a _Positional Clue_ to the very next player.
- The only exceptions is when it is an extraordinary situation or it is very obvious to the team what is going on.

<br />

### Color Positional Clues

- A color positional clue corresponds to a slot number that is based on the order of the stacks. Stacks correspond to the slot numbers **from right to left**.
  - For example, in a 3-player game of the _Null (6 Suit)_ variant, there are 5 color clues and 5 slots in the hand. Thus, a purple clue equals slot 5 (since it is the right-most color), a blue clue equals slot 4 (since it is the 2nd right-most color), and so forth.
    <ColorPositional6 />
  - For example, in a 3-player game of the _Null (5 Suit)_ variant, there are 4 color clues and 5 slots in the hand. Thus, a blue clue equals slot 5 (since it is the right-most color), a green clue equals slot 4 (since it is the 2nd right-most color), and so forth.
    <ColorPositional5 />

#### Color Positional Clues Skip Over Clued Cards

- When players are determining which slot number the _Color Positional Clue_ is talking about, they should always skip over any cards that have one or more positive clues on them.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (5 Suits)" variant:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks except for the null 1.
  - Bob hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `red 1, red 1, null 1, blue 1, blue 5`
  - Bob's blue 5 has a number 5 clue on it. (It was clued with a _5 Save_ earlier on.)
  - Alice clues green to Cathy, touching a green 1.
  - Bob knows that normally, this would be an _Unknown Trash Discharge_. But all _Discharges_ are "turned off" in null variants. Instead, this must be a _Null Positional Clue_.
  - Bob knows that if his hand was completely unclued, green would refer to slot 4, since there are 5 slots in the hand and green is the 2nd rightmost color. But since Bob's slot 5 card already has a clue on it, he should skip over that card. So this must be targeting his slot 3 (e.g. his 2nd rightmost unclued slot).
  - Bob blind-plays null 1 from slot 3.

<ColorPositionalSkipClued />

#### Color Positional Clues Wrap Around

- _Color Positional Clues_ always "wrap around" to the oldest card. In other words, if they go "past" slot 1, then they would apply to slot 5 again.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (5 Suits)" variant:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks except for the null 1.
  - Bob hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `null 1, red 1, red 5, blue 5, green 5`
  - All of Bob's 5's have a number 5 clue on them. (They were clued with a _5 Save_ earlier on.)
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1.
  - Bob knows that normally, this would be an _Unknown Trash Discharge_. But all _Discharges_ are "turned off" in null variants. Instead, this must be a _Null Positional Clue_.
  - Bob knows that if his hand was completely unclued, red would refer to slot 2, since there are 5 slots in the hand and red is the 4th rightmost color. But since Bob's slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 card already have a clue on it, he should skip over those cards.
  - This means that blue would target slot 2 and green would target slot 1. Yellow would target slot 2 again (because of the wraparound) and red would target slot 1.
  - Bob blind-plays null 1 from slot 1.

<ColorPositionalWrapAround />

#### One-of-Each Colors Are Skipped

- One-of-each colors are skipped over when finding the "rightmost color". This is because the right-most color is the most important color, and one-of-each colors are less likely to be around.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Black & Null (6 Suits)" variant:
  - Everyone has 5 cards in their hand.
  - There are 5 possible colors: red, yellow, green, blue, and black.
  - Normally, the rightmost color would be black, meaning that black would be assigned to slot 5. But black is skipped over, so blue is assigned to slot 5.
  - Subsequently, green is assigned to slot 4, yellow is assigned to slot 3, and red is assigned to slot 2.
  - Black is then assigned to slot 1. (In a 4-player game with 4 cards in the hand, then black would wrap-around and be assigned to the oldest slot again.)

### Null Saves

Some additional rules apply to _Positional Clues_ that are intended to be _Save Clues_.

#### Relaxed 2 Saves

- It is optional for players to give _Save Clues_ to null 2's.
- Thus, if a null 2 is discarded, players should not make any _Elimination Notes_ for them.

#### No Early Null 3 or Null 4 Saves

- It is considered illegal to perform any kind of _Chop Move_ on a non-critical null 3 or a non-critical null 4.
  - This rule counts for both _Positional Saves_ and normal _Chop Moves_ (such as the _5's Chop Move_).
- Thus, when a player is _Chop Moved_ early on for a null card, they can know for sure that it is either a null 2 or a null 5.

<br />

### Positional Bluffs

- Since _Positional Clues_ can only be given in _Bluff Seat_, it is also possible to use a _Positional Clue_ to get a non-null card.
- This is a _Positional Bluff_, because Bob expects to be playing a null card.
- Similar to a normal _Bluff_, a _Positional Bluff_ only "gets" 1 card. No actual null cards are promised.

### No Positional Finesses

- Theoretically, it would be possible to do a _Finesse_ with a _Positional Clue_. However, we explicitly disallow this.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Null 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice gives a _Positional Clue_, indicating that someone should play a null card from slot 4.
  - Bob sees that Cathy has a null 3 on her slot 4.
  - Bob plays his _Finesse Position_ as a null 2 (into the null 3).
  - Bob misplays a red 5 and loses the game.
  - Bob realizes that the null 2 was actually on his slot 4.

### The Scream Blind-Play (Blind-Playing Chop)

- Sometimes, a player will have two critical cards in a row on chop. Usually, the team will work together to clue both of the cards. However, in variants with a null suit, it is sometimes difficult to do this.
- In cases where one player needs to save two cards at once, they can perform a _Scream Blind-Play_ by blind-playing their chop card. This is similar to a _Scream Discard_, except it _Chop Moves_ two cards instead of one.
- Just like the _Scream Discard_, the _Scream Blind-Play_ is only to be used as a last resort.
