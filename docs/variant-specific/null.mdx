These conventions apply to any variant with a null (touched by no clues) suit. They are turned off once all null cards are played or globally known.

### The Null Kick

- When null cards are newly drawn, they can usually be gotten by _Bluffs_, _Ejections_, and _Discharges_. However, it can sometimes be difficult to get cards near the back of the player's hand.
- Therefore, in variants with a null suit, we replace less commonly used _Ejections_ with a move called a _Kick_. A _Kick_ signals that the next player should blind-play their chop. (_Chop Moved_ cards should never be blind-played from a _Kick_.)
- Specifically, _Replay Ejections_, _Poke Ejections_, _Trash Ejections_ and _Double Ejections_ are turned off, and instead signal a _Null Kick_.
- Similar to _Bluffs_, _Ejections_, and _Discharges_, _Kicks_ must be performed on the very next player.
- Note that a _Double Ignition_ takes precedence over a _Null Kick_; if Bob sees that someone else has a playable card on finesse position, that interpretation should be preferred.

#### The Null Kick Finesse

- Since it is usually very easy to get non-null cards on a player's chop, we agree that _Null Kicks_ should be used only to get null cards.
- Thus, if Bob blind-plays a non-null card into a _Null Kick_, he should continue blind-playing cards until he finds a null card.
- In this situation, Bob should blind-play his _Second Chop_, _Third Chop_, and so on, until he reaches his _First Finesse Position_. If he has still has not blind-played a null card, he should then play his _Chop Moved_ cards from left to right.

### Null 5 Tech

- _Bluffs_, _Ejections_, _Discharges_, and _Kicks_ are useful to get null cards played. However, we need a separate and more reliable way to deal with null saves.
- The main tool for this is to use number 5 clues.
- The _5 Save_ and the _5's Chop Move_ still work the same as they would in a no variant game. However, the following conventions are turned off:
  - _Play Clues_ with a number 5 (including on a previously clued 5)
  - The _5 Stall_
  - The _5 Pull_
  - The _5 Number Discharge_
- These moves are replaced with other things; see below.

#### The Null 5 Chop Move

- When Alice gives a number 5 clue that is not a _5 Save_ or a _5's Chop Move_, **as long as Bob is not loaded**, it signals a _Null 5 Chop Move_ on Bob.
  - Note that the number 5 clue can be given to any player; it does not necessarily have to be on Bob.
- The _Null 5 Chop Move_ is **only** allowed to save null cards that are playable / phantom playable or critical (or a null 2 that isn't visible elsewhere, same as an ordinary _2 Save_).
- This convention applies only to Bob; see _The Double Save_ for saving other players.

#### The Loaded 5 Null Play Clue

- When Alice gives a number 5 clue that is not a _5 Save_ or a _5's Chop Move_, **if Bob is loaded**, it signals a _Loaded 5 Null Play Clue_ to Bob.
  - Note that the number 5 clue can be given to any player; it does not necessarily have to be on Bob.
- Bob should immediately play his rightmost card with no positive clues. Notably, if Bob is _Chop Moved_, he should play his rightmost _Chop Moved_ card.
- This convention applies only to Bob.

#### Interaction With Pink

- _Pink Promise_ does not apply to number 5 clues, except for _5 Saves_, _5's Chop Moves_, and _Turnabout Ejections_.
- In particular, it is not possible to perform a _Bubblegum Finesse_ or a _Bubblegum Bluff_ with a number 5 clue.

### Saving Multiple Cards

#### Double Save Situations

- Given that the _Null 5 Chop Move_ only applies to Bob and only chop moves one card, it can be difficult to save two critical cards in a row on Bob.
- A _Double Save Situation_ occurs when:
  1. Cathy is not loaded.
  2. Cathy has a critical null card on her chop.
  3. Cathy has any critical card on her second chop (the next unclued card after the chop).
  4. Cathy's two critical cards cannot be saved with one clue (e.g. a _5 Chop Move_, a _Trash Chop Move_, or an _Unnecessary Reverse Trash Finesse_).

#### The Double Save

- In the _Double Save_, Alice gives a number 5 clue, similar to a _Null 5 Chop Move_. But Bob does not _Chop Move_, and instead immediately performs a second _Save Clue_ or _Chop Move_ on Cathy.
- _Double Saves_ can only be performed in _Double Save Situation_.
- When a _Double Save_ interpretation is possible, Cathy should always assume that a _Double Save_ has occurred. In other words, Cathy should not assume that Alice performed a _Null 5 Chop Move_ on Bob and that Bob gave her a play clue.
- Since the necessity of saving 2s is not symmetric, _Double Saves_ may not be initiated to save non-critical 2s.
- Note that _Double Saves_ may be performed regardless of whether Bob is loaded.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (5 Suits)" variant:
  - The red 3 is played on the stacks. The green 4 is discarded.
  - Bob has already been given a _Play Clue_ on a yellow 1, but has not played it yet. He also has a playable null 1 in as his rightmost card.
  - Cathy has two critical cards on chop: the null 5 and the green 4.
  - To save these cards, Alice initiates a _Double Save_ by cluing number 5 clue to Cathy, which forces Bob clue a number 4 to Cathy.
  - Normally, since Bob is loaded, he would consider this to be a _Loaded 5 Null Play Clue_, and would play his chop. However, Bob knows that _Double Save_ situations take precedence over _Loaded 5 Null Play Clues_.
  - Normally, since Cathy sees that Bob has a playable null 1 on chop, she would consider this to be a _Loaded 5 Null Play Clue_. However, Cathy knows that _Double Save_ situations take precedence over _Loaded 5 Null Play Clues_.

#### The Double Save Corollary

- Since Cathy should always assume a _Double Save_ occurred whenever it is possible, Alice must take care not to create ambiguous situations by performing a _Null 5 Chop Move_ at the wrong time.
- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (5 Suits)" variant:
  - The red 2, yellow 2, green 2, and blue 2 are all played on the stacks.
  - Bob and Cathy both have critical null cards on chop.
  - Alice should refrain from trying to save Bob's critical card now.
  - This is because using a _Null 5 Chop Move_ on Bob would prevent Bob from doing a _Null 5 Chop Move_ on Cathy, since it would look like a _Double Save_.
  - Thus, Alice can clue number 1 to Bob as a _Trash Chop Move_. Alternatively, Alice can discard and count on Bob to save Cathy's critical null card.

<BadDoubleSave1 />

- For example, in a 3-player game of the "Null (5 Suits)" variant:
  - The red 1, yellow 1, and blue 1 are played on the stacks. The yellow 4 is discarded.
  - Bob has a critical null card on chop, and Cathy has a playable yellow 2.
  - If Alice clues number 5 to Bob as a _Null 5 Chop Move_, Bob will be unable to get the yellow 2 to play.
  - This is because if Bob were to clue yellow to Cathy, it would look like a _Double Save_ on the null 3 and the yellow 4.
  - Thus, Alice should probably clue the green 1 or discard.

<BadDoubleSave2 />

### Relaxed 1 and 2 Saves

- It is optional for players to give _Save Clues_ to null 2's.
- Thus, if a null 2 is discarded, players should not make any _Elimination Notes_ for it.
- Similarly, it is optional to "get" the first copy of the null 1.
- If the first copy of the null 1 was difficult to get played and is discarded, players should not make any _Elimination Notes_ for it.
