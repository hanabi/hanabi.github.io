These conventions apply to any variant with a null (touched by no clues) suit. They are turned off once all null cards are played or globally known.

<br />

### The Null Ignition Kick

- When null cards are newly drawn, they can usually be gotten by bluffs, ejections and discharges. However, it can sometimes be difficult to get cards near the back of the player's hand. 
- Therefore, in variants with a null suit, we replace less commonly used ejections with a null ignition kick. Specifically, *Replay Ejections*, *Poke Ejections*, *Trash Ejections* and *Double Ejections* are turned off, and instead signal a *Null Ignition Kick*.
- When Alice clues a *Null Ignition Kick*, Bob should immediately play his chop (he should not attempt to play chop moved cards from this).
- This convention applies only to Bob, and Null Finesses are explicitly illegal.
- Note that a *Double Ignition* takes precedence over a *Null Ignition Kick*; if Bob sees that someone else has a playable card on finesse position, that interpretation should be preferred.

<br />

### Null 5 Tech

- The main tool to get null cards is to use number 5 clues. When Alice gives a number 5 clue, all players must pay careful attention to whether Bob was loaded on that turn.
- The *5 Save* and *5's Chop Move* are still on, but play clues with 5 (including on a previously clued 5), the *5 Pull*, and the *5 Number Discharge* are usually turned off.

#### No 5 Stalls

- Except on the very first turn of the game (if there is nothing else to do), players may not perform a *5 Stall* for any reason. This is because stalling situations very frequently overlap with situations where a null card must be saved.

#### The Null 5 Chop Move

- When Alice gives a number 5 clue that is not a *5 Save* nor a *5's Chop Move*, **if Bob is not loaded**, this signals a *Null 5 Chop Move* on Bob. 
- This may be done only to save null cards, and only if they are critical or are a null 2 which is not available on any other player's non-chop (just like with ordinary *2 Saves*.
- This convention applies only to Bob; see *The Double Save* for saving other players.

#### The Loaded 5 Tech Clue

- When Alice gives a number 5 clue to a previously unclued 5 that is not a *5 Save* nor a *5's Chop Move*, **if Bob is loaded**, this signals the ordinary convention for that 5 clue.
- This can be a *5 Pull* or a *5 Number Discharge* in the *Low Score Phase*, or a *Play Clue* on the 5 outside of the *Low Score Phase*.

#### The Loaded 5 Null Play Clue

- When Alice gives a number 5 clue to a previously clued 5, **if Bob is loaded**, this signals a *Loaded 5 Null Play Clue* to Bob.
- Bob should immediately play his rightmost card with no positive clues; noteably, if Bob is *Chop Moved*, he should play his rightmost *Chop Moved* card.
- This convention applies only to Bob, and Null Finesses are explicitly illegal.
- Note that play clues with a number clue to a previously clued 5 are always off.

### Saving Multiple Cards

#### Double Save Situations
- Sometimes, a player will have multiple cards on chop that need to be saved. In this case, the team will cooperate and use multiple clues to save all of the required cards.
- Given that the above conventions apply only to Bob, it can be difficult to save null cards on chop and then immediately to save further critical cards.
- A *Double Save Situation* occurs when:
  1. Cathy is not loaded.
  2. Cathy has a critical null card on her *Chop*.
  3. The previous unclued card (Cathy's next chop after a save) is a critical card.
  4. Cathy's critical cards cannot all be saved cleanly with one clue, e.g. a *5 Chop Move*, a *Trash Chop Move*, or an *Unnecessary Reverse Trash Finesse*.

#### The Double Save
- The *Double Save* allows for Alice and Bob to give two consecutive save clues to Cathy. This may be done only in a *Double Save Situation*.
- Alice may give a 5 clue, similar to a *Null 5 Chop Move*.
- In a Double Save Situation, Bob **must** immediately give another save clue to Cathy, and he should not mark a *Null 5 Chop Move* on himself.
- When a *Double Save* interpretation is possible, Cathy should always assume that a *Double Save* has occurred; she should not assume that Alice performed a *Null 5 Chop Move* on Bob and that Bob gave her a play clue.
- Since the necessity of saving 2s is not symmetric and can depend on Alice's and Bob's hands, *Double Saves* may not be initiated to save non-critical 2s.
- Note that doublesaves may be performed regardless of whether Bob is loaded.


#### The Double Save Corollary
- Since Cathy should always assume a *Double Save* occurred whenever it is possible, Alice must take care not to create ambniguous situations by performing a *Null 5 Chop Move* at the wrong time.
- For example, if Bob and Cathy both have critical null cards on their chops without Cathy's hand giving rise to a *Double Save Situation*, and Alice choses to perform a *Null 5 Chop Move* on Bob, then Bob cannot perform a *Null 5 Chop Move* on Cathy, as it would look like a *Double Save*; Alice should either wait for Bob to save Cathy first, or ensure that Cathy has something else to do.

#### Relaxed 1 and 2 Saves

- It is optional for players to give _Save Clues_ to null 2's.
- Thus, if a null 2 is discarded, players should not make any _Elimination Notes_ for them.
- Similarly, it is optional to play the first copy of the null 1.
- If the first copy of the null 1 was difficult to get played and is discarded, players should not make any _Elimination Notes_ for it.
