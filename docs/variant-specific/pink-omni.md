These conventions apply to variants that have 50% or more of cards touched by all ranks. (For example, in the "Pink & Omni (3 Suit)" variant, 66% of the cards are touched by all ranks, so these convention would apply.)

### Pink & Omni Majority Conventions

- Just like in normal games, if a rank clue is given to a chop card and it could be a *Save Clue* (e.g. a *2 Save*, *5 Save*, critical pink 3 save, etc.), then it is treated as a *Save Clue*.
- Any **other** type of rank clue is instead treated as a *Positional Clue*, telling the person who is clued to play the respective slot number.
  - These kind of *Positional Clues* can be *Delayed Play Clues*, *Reverse Finesses*, and so forth.
