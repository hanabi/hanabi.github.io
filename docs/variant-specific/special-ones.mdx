These conventions apply to "Special-Ones" variants (e.g. "Pink-Ones", "Rainbow-Ones", etc.).

## Deceptive Ones

### Prompting 1's

- In this variant, it is possible to have 1's in a player's hand that are "misranked".
- _Finesses_ in this variant work the same as in a regular pink variant: play _Finesse Position_ instead of a potentially misranked 1.

## Omni Ones

### Red Fix Clue

- Normally, when cards are re-clued with a red color clue, this would be interpreted as a _Tempo Clue_. However, in an omni-ones variant, this is instead interpreted as a _Fix Clue_.
- We arbitrarily choose red since it is the left-most color.

## Pink Ones

### Play Clues on 1's with Number 2, Number 3, or Number 4

- In this variant, it is not possible to clue number 1 to a player.
- Thus, players will usually give a _Play Clue_ to a 1 with a color clue.
- Alternatively, a player can also give a _Play Clue_ to a 1 with a number 2 clue, a number 3 clue, or a number 4 clue.
- In this situation, the player knows to play the focused card and to hold on to the rest of the cards for later.
- This interpretation only applies if it is not possible to be a _Finesse_. (_Self-Finesses_ don't count.)
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching two 3's on slot 1 + slot 2 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob sees that Cathy does not have a playable card on her _Finesse Position_. (If she did, then Bob would need to wait to see what Cathy does.)
  - Bob knows that this is just a _Play Clue_ on a 1. Bob plays his slot 1 card. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Bob knows that his slot 2 card can either be another good 1 or a 3.

### Prompting 1's

- In this variant, it is possible to have 1's in a player's hand that are "misranked".
- _Finesses_ in this variant work the same as in a regular pink variant: play _Finesse Position_ instead of a potentially misranked 1.

## Rainbow Ones

### Color Promise

- When giving a color clue to a rainbow-one, you are expected to use the color that matches the card.
- There are some exceptions, which are listed below.

### The Color Play Clue Lie

- First, see the section on the _[Pink Play Clue Lie](pink.mdx#the-pink-play-clue-lie-ppcl-with-a-mismatched-play-clue-that-touches-other-cards)_ (for pink variants).
- Similar to how the _Pink Play Clue Lie_ violates _Pink Promise_, you can do a _Color Play Clue Lie_ to violate _Color Promise_ in the same way.
- In other words, you can break _Color Promise_ if and only if:
  - using a "wrong" color would get extra cards (e.g. a 2-for-1 instead of a 1-for-1)
  - the card would play immediately or very soon
  - no-one else would be confused
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - The variant is "Rainbow-Ones (6 Suits)".
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, touching a blue 1 on slot 1 and a red 3 on slot 2.
  - Bob assumes that it is red 1 and plays it. It is instead the blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Bob reasons that Alice lied about the color identity of the 1 so that she could "get" the card on his slot 2 "for free".

### The Color Promise Finesse

- First, see the section on the _[Color Play Clue Lie](#the-color-play-clue-lie)_.
- Usually, when _Color Promise_ is violated, it is a _Color Play Clue Lie_. But what if _Color Promise_ is violated and the clue is only a 1-for-1? The clue giver must be trying to communicate something extra.
- In this situation, the next player should blind-play their _Finesse Position_ card as a _Color Promise Finesse_.
- For example, in 3-player game:
  - The variant is "Rainbow-Ones (6 Suits)".
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a blue 1 on slot 1.
  - Bob sees that Cathy's hand has no other blue cards in it, so there is no good reason why Alice could not have just clued blue to Cathy and satisfied _Color Promise_. Alice must be trying to communicate something extra.
  - Bob knows that this is a _Color Promise Finesse_ and blind-plays his finesse position. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that Alice performed a _Finesse_ and that Cathy must have the red 2 that connects to the red 1 that was blind-played.
  - Cathy plays the red card and it is blue 1. It successfully plays.
  - Cathy now knows that Alice performed a _Color Promise Finesse_ instead of a normal _Finesse_.
- Note that the _Color Promise Finesse_ can only be performed if the card that is blind-played connects to the clue that was given. Otherwise, Cathy will think that a _Bluff_ happened and will not play the clued card.

### The Color Prompt Exception (for Rainbow-Ones)

- First, see the section on the _[Pink Prompt Rank Exception](pink.mdx#the-pink-prompt-rank-exception)_ (for pink variants).
- Similar to how there is a _Pink Prompt Rank Exception_ for pink cards, there is also a _Color Prompt Exception_ for rainbow-ones.
- In other words, cards in a player's hand that are clued with a single color clue are not treated to be a potential 1.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Bob's slot 2 card has a green clue on it (and no other positive or negative clues).
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 2 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that if the green card in his hand is red 1, then this would be a _Prompt_.
  - Bob knows that if the green card in his hand is not red 1, then this would be a _Finesse_.
  - Bob knows that normally, _Prompts_ are supposed to take precedence over _Finesses_. However, in this case, since his green card only has a single color clue on it, the _Color Prompt Exception_ applies, so he should assume a finesse.
  - Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
