These conventions apply to the "Odds and Evens" variants.

<br />

### Odd Clues Are 5 Saves

- An "odd" clue that focuses a chop card is treated as a *5 Save*. (It doesn't have to be a *5 Save*, but players have to consider that it could be.)
- However, the *Always Loaded Principle* applies.

### Even Clues are 2 Saves

- An "even" clue that focuses a chop card is treated as a *2 Save*. (It doesn't have to be a *2 Save*, but players have to consider that it could be.)
- However, the *Always Loaded Principle* applies.

### The Odd Prompt Rank Exception

- Similar to the *Pink Prompt Rank Exception*, we agree that *Prompts* do not apply to cards with an odd clue on them, because they could be an unplayable 5.
- This exception does not apply to even cards. Thus, it is possible to *Wrong Prompt* a player who has unplayable 4's with an even clue on them.

### The Ambiguous O&E Tempo Clue

- Similar to the *[Ambiguous Prism Tempo Clue](prism.md#the-ambiguous-prism-tempo-clue)*, we agree that certain kinds of *Tempo Clues* promise that different kinds of cards are focused:
  - a color *Tempo Clue* should focus the right-most card
  - an odd or even *Tempo Clue* should focus the left most card
