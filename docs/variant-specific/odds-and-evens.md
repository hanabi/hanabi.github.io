These conventions apply to the "Odds and Evens" variants.

<br />

### Odd Clues Are 5 Saves

- An "odd" clue that focuses a chop card is treated as a _5 Save_. (It doesn't have to be a _5 Save_, but players have to consider that it could be.)
- However, the _Always Loaded Principle_ applies.

### Even Clues are 2 Saves

- An "even" clue that focuses a chop card is treated as a _2 Save_. (It doesn't have to be a _2 Save_, but players have to consider that it could be.)
- However, the _Always Loaded Principle_ applies.

### The Odd Prompt Rank Exception

- Similar to the _Pink Prompt Rank Exception_, we agree that _Prompts_ do not apply to cards with an odd clue on them, because they could be an unplayable 5.
- This exception does not apply to even cards. Thus, it is possible to _Wrong Prompt_ a player who has unplayable 4's with an even clue on them.

### The Ambiguous O&E Tempo Clue

- Similar to the _[Ambiguous Prism Tempo Clue](prism.md#the-ambiguous-prism-tempo-clue)_, we agree that certain kinds of _Tempo Clues_ promise that different kinds of cards are focused:
  - a color _Tempo Clue_ should focus the right-most card
  - an odd or even _Tempo Clue_ should focus the left most card
