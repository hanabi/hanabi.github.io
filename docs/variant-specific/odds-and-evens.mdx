These conventions apply to the "Odds and Evens" variants.

### Odd Clues Are 5 Saves

- An "odd" clue that focuses a chop card is treated as a _5 Save_. (It doesn't have to be a _5 Save_, but players have to consider that it could be.)
- However, the _Always Loaded Principle_ applies.

### Even Clues are 2 Saves

- An "even" clue that focuses a chop card is treated as a _2 Save_. (It doesn't have to be a _2 Save_, but players have to consider that it could be.)
- However, the _Always Loaded Principle_ applies.

### The Odd Prompt Rank Exception

- Similar to the _Pink Prompt Rank Exception_, we agree that _Prompts_ do not apply to cards with **only** an odd clue on them, because they could be an unplayable 5.
- This exception does not apply to cards known to be not 5. (For example, if the card was used with a _Bluff_ initiated by an an odd clue.)
- This exception does not apply to even cards. Thus, it is possible to _Wrong Prompt_ a player who has unplayable 4's with an even clue on them.

### The 5 Odd Ejection

- First, see the section on the _[5 Color Ejection](../level-16#the-5-color-ejection-5ce)_.
- An _Play Clue_ initiated with an odd clue to a 5 signals an _Ejection_ on the next player if they have to **blind-play two or more cards** to fulfill the _Finesse_. (This is similar to how _5 Color Ejection_ works.)
- The _Odd Prompt Rank Exception_ applies when counting the blind-plays.
- Players should be careful with odd clues focused on chop. Depending on if the _Always Loaded Principle_ applies, the clue can be a _Save Clue_, a _5 Odd Ejection_ or a _Rank Choice Ejection_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 4 is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy has a red card clued in her hand. From _Good Touch Principle_, she assumes that it is the red 5.
  - The only yellow card that both Alice and Bob see is Cathy's yellow 5.
  - Alice gives an odd clue to Cathy, touching a yellow 5 on chop.
  - Since Cathy is loaded with a playable red card, the _Always Loaded Principle_ applies. Therefore, the odd clue is a _Play Clue_ on the yellow 5.
  - Since Bob has to blind-play two or more cards to fulfill the _Finesse_, he knows this is a _5 Odd Ejection_. Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Cathy knows an _Ejection_ happened. The only ejection that matches this sequence is a _5 Odd Ejection_, so she marks her odd card as any non-red 5.

### The Ambiguous O&E Tempo Clue

- The _Ambiguous Tempo Clue_ convention applies in odds and evens, and we agree that:
  - a color _Tempo Clue_ should focus the right-most card.
  - an odd or even _Tempo Clue_ should focus the left most card.
