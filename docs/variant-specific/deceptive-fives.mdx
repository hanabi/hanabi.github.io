These conventions apply to the "Deceptive-Fives" variants.

<br />

### Deceptive 5 Saves

- Any color clue to a chop card is first and foremost to be treated as a _Save Clue_ on a 5.

### Deceptive Loaded Play Clues

- _Loaded Play Clues_ are turned on but only apply to the color clues focusing on _Chop_.

### Rank Save Promise

- The rank of a _Chop-Focus_ number clue must match the number of the card. In other words, players are not allowed to use a rank clue to touch a 5 if it is on chop.

### Deceptive-Five Number Ejection

- If a player breaks the _Rank Save Promise_, they must be intending to send an additional message.
- In this situation, the intent is to have the next player _Eject_. When this happens, the clue receiver should mark their card as a 5.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice gives a number 3 clue, touching a green 5 in Cathy's hand.
  - If Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_, then Cathy would mark her card as a 3, which would be bad.
  - Instead, Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_ as a _Deceptive-Five Number Ejection_. It is a yellow 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that an _Ejection_ happened. The only _Ejection_ that matches this sequence of events is a _Deceptive-Five Number Ejection_, so she marks her 3 as a 5.

### The Ambiguous Deceptive-Five Tempo Clue

- The _Ambiguous Tempo Clue_ convention applies, and we agree that:
  - a color _Tempo Clue_ should focus the right-most card.
  - an odd or even _Tempo Clue_ should focus the left most card.
