### Special Move Summary

- If a clue is focusing a critical card on chop, then it is probably a _Save Clue_, as mentioned in the "Basic Conventions" section above.
- If a clue is focusing a card that is not on chop, then it is a _Play Clue_, and the following table applies:

| Type of Clue                           | Interpretation                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Any clue focusing a one-away card      | A _Finesse_, a _Transparent Bluff_, or a _Transparent Double Bluff_ |
| Any clue focusing a two-or-more-away 5 | An _Ejection_ (similar to 5CE)                                      |
| Any clue focusing a two-or-more-away 3 | A _Discharge_ (because 3 means slot 3)                              |
| Any clue focusing a two-or-more-away 4 | A _Charm_ (e.g. the 4th _Finesse Position_)                         |

- For more specific information, see each section below.

### The Transparent Bluff

- Normally, you cannot perform a _Bluff_ in variants without any positive information. This is because the blind-play will always look like it "connects" to the clue target.
- However, the one exception to this is if a 5 blind-plays. Then, the clue receiver can know that it is a _Bluff_ (because there is no card that connects to a 5).
- In this situation, the clue receiver would mark their touched card as a one-away-from-playable card.

### The Transparent Double Bluff

- Normally, you cannot perform a _Bluff_ in variants without any positive information. This is because the blind-play will always look like it "connects" to the clue target.
- However, it is possible to perform a _Double Bluff_ by cluing any one-away-from-playable card and getting two non-connected cards to play.
- For example, in a 4-player game of the Duck variant:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 2 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob tries to blind-play red 1 from his _Finesse Position_, but he instead blind-plays the blue 1.
  - Cathy sees that Donald will go on to misplay the red 2 as the blue 2. Thus, this must be a _Double Bluff_, so Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card. It is a green 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Donald knows that he cannot have the blue 2, or else Cathy would not have done anything special. Donald's card can be any one-away-from-playable card in the game.
- _Double Half-Bluffs_ are explicitly outlawed. In other words, the first blind-play from a _Double Bluff_ must be completely unrelated to the card that was clued. (This is so that the clue-receiver will have more specific information.)

### 5 Ejection

- _5 Color Ejection_ is turned on in variants without any positive information, just like it is in any other variant.
- Additionally, players can also perform _5 Number Ejection_ and it will generally work in the exact same way.
- Thus, players should keep in mind that clues that cause _Ejection_ might have been either a color clue or a number clue.

### 3 Discharge

- _Unknown Trash Discharge_ is turned off in variants without any positive information.
- Instead, _3 Discharge_ is turned on. In other words, a _Play Clue_ focusing a two-or-more-away-from-playable 3 is a signal for the next player to play their _Third Finesse Position_.
- Similar to _5 Ejection_, _3 Discharge_ can be initiated with either a color clue or a number clue.
- When all the 3's have been played or accounted for, _Unknown Trash Discharge_ is turned back on.

### 4 Charm

- _Charm_ is defined as a move that makes a player play their _Fourth Finesse Position_.
- A _Play Clue_ focusing a two-or-more-away-from-playable 4 is a signal for the next player to play their _Fourth Finesse Position_.
- Similar to _5 Ejection_, _4 Charm_ can be initiated with either a color clue or a number clue.
