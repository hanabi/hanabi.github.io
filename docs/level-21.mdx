## Special Moves

<br />

### Phantom Playable Cards

- First, see the section on [the definition of "playable" cards](level-1.mdx#the-definition-of-playable).
- For a card to be _delayed playable_, it needs to be playable "through" other clued cards or "through" cards on _Finesse Position_. In other words, we are allowed to give _Play Clues_ to _delayed playable_ cards.
- Consider that a slightly different category of card can exist. A card is _Phantom Playable_ if it is playable "through" cards that are visible in someone's hand, but the in-between cards are not on _Finesse Position_ and are not yet clued. We are **not** allowed to give _Play Clues_ to _Phantom Playable_ cards - at least not until the other cards are clued first.
- From _Save Principle_, we know that everyone agrees to not let _playable_ or _delayed playable_ cards get discarded.
- If possible, the team should also try to protect _Phantom Playable_ cards from being discarded as well, since they are nearly as important as _delayed playable_ cards. For example, it is common for other people on the team to discard in order to let the player with the _Phantom Playable_ card be the one to give a _Play Clue_ to the in-between card.
- Sometimes, _Phantom Playable_ cards have to be discarded when the team is low on clues or in an otherwise tight situation. While regrettable, this is perfectly okay and does happen from time to time.

### The Scream Discard for a Phantom Playable Card

- First, see the section on the _[Scream Discard](level-6.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)_ and the section on _[Phantom Playable Cards](#phantom-playable-cards)_.
- Normally, you are only allowed to perform a _Scream Discard_ for a critical card or a playable card. But what about a _Phantom Playable Card_?
- In most cases, players should also _Scream Discard_ for a _Phantom Playable Card_, but it depends on the situation:
  - Will it be clear to everyone what is happening?
  - Will the in-between cards get clued right away?
  - Are there other critical cards on chop that need to be saved or will need to be saved soon?
  - Is the _Phantom Playable_ card a 3 or a 4?
- In summary, it is better for the team to let a _Phantom Playable_ card get discarded in a tricky or tight situation, **especially** if it is a 4.
- Another way of saying this is that the team should never "bend over backwards" for a _Phantom Playable_ card. Consider that a _Scream Discard_ always has a small chance to lose the game (if the _Scream Discarded_ card was itself critical).

<br />

### The Sacrifice Discard

- First, see the section on the _[Scream Discard](level-6.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)_.
- It is generally undesirable for a player to have a _Locked_ hand, but sometimes it happens. And sometimes, one card in the locked hand is useful in the future, but not critical (meaning there is another copy of the card in someone else's hand or still in the deck).
- Normally, you are never supposed to discard cards that have clues on them. And if you do, it implies a _Sarcastic Discard_ or a _Gentleman's Discard_. However, when a player is locked, they can choose to "sacrifice" one of the cards in their hand that is non-critical. And in this situation, it does **not** imply a _Sarcastic Discard_ or a _Gentleman's Discard_.
- Sometimes, when a _Locked_ player discards a non-critical card, it is a _Generation Discard_, and sometimes, it is a _Sacrifice Discard_. The other players on the team just have to decide which one it is based on how well the game is going. Usually, it is pretty obvious which one of the two it is, as _Sacrifice Discards_ are usually very rare and are only done in very dire situations.

<br />

### The Shout Discard Chop Move

- First, see the section on the _[Scream Discard](level-6.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)_.
- Normally, when a player performs a _Scream Discard_, they are discarding their chop (e.g. an unknown and unclued card).
- However, if a player has both a known-playable card and a known-trash card, then discarding the known-trash card instead of playing their known-playable card can still accomplish the same thing as a _Scream Discard_. This is called a _Shout Discard_ to distinguish it from the more-ordinary case.
- In other words:
  - a _Scream Discard_ is when you send an emergency signal by discarding an unknown card when you have a known-playable card
  - a _Shout Discard_ is when you send an emergency signal by discarding a known-trash card when you have a known-playable card
- A _Shout Discard_ _Chop Moves_ the very next player in the exact way that a _Scream Discard_ does.
- A _Shout Discard_ forces the next player to **not** discard on their turn in the exact way that a _Scream Discard_ does.
- Normally, a _Scream Discard_ is only allowed to _Chop Move_ a critical card or a playable card. However, unlike a _Scream Discard_, it is permissible to use a _Shout Discard_ to _Chop Move_ any card that is desirable, even if it is not critical or playable.
- Normally, a _Scream Discard_ is only allowed if the team is at 0 clues (or if cluing the card is impossible). However, unlike a _Scream Discard_, it is permissible to use a _Shout Discard_ to _Chop Move_ regardless of the number of clues that the team has.
- Normally, a _Scream Discard_ would turn into an _Echo Scream Discard_ if the next player has a playable card (see below). _Shout Discards_ can also turn into _Echo Shout Discards_, but only if the team is completely out of clues and it can be seen to be a "last-resort" move.

<br />

### The Scream Discard Chop Move (With Known-Trash)

- First, see the section on the _[Scream Discard](level-6.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)_.
- Occasionally, a player will have one or more known-trash cards in their hand. In this situation, the player is expected to first discard their known-trash card(s) before discarding their chop.
- Subsequently, if a player discards their chop instead of discarding their known-trash card, it must be a signal that something is wrong. This should trigger a _Scream Discard_ in the same way that discarding chop with a known-playable card would.
- Even though this move is triggered in a separate way from a normal _Scream Discard_, we still call it a _Scream Discard_ since it is so similar.
- It is illegal for a player to discard their chop if they have both a known-playable card and a known-trash card in their hand. (In this situation, if the player wanted to perform a _Scream Discard_ in this situation, they would discard their known-trash card.) If a player does this, it is to be treated as a known-mistake.

<br />

### The Echo Scream Discard Chop Move

- First, see the section on the _[Scream Discard](level-6.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)_.
- A _Scream Discard Chop Move_ is done only as a last resort. So, if the next player has an unimportant card on chop, then the move is usually a _Generation Discard_ and does not _Chop Move_ anyone.
- However, what if a _Scream Discard_ is done and the next player has either:
  - a known playable card
  - a known safe trash discard
- Since _Scream Discards_ are only done as a last resort, the clue must have some other meaning. So, it _Chop Moves_ both the next player **and** the player after that. This is called an _Echo Scream Discard_, because it "bounces" off the next player and travels to the next player after that as a "double scream".
- Similar to a normal _Scream Discard_, all of the players who are _Chop Moved_ are not allowed to discard on their next turn.
- In the unlikely scenario where **two** people in a row have known plays / known safe discards, then the _Echo Scream Discard_ will bounce off of two people and perform **three** _Chop Moves_ in total. (And three people in a row cause four _Chop Moves_, and so forth.)
- An _Echo Scream Discard_ still works in the same way even when done with known-trash.

<br />

### The Composition Discard

- First, see the section on the _[Scream Discard](level-6.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)_ and the _[Generation Discard](level-6.mdx#the-generation-discard)_.
- In rare cases, it is possible for a discard to be both a _Scream Discard_ and a _Generation Discard_ at the same time, for two different players.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - There are 0 clues in the bank.
  - Alice needs to plan ahead for her turn.
  - Bob and Donald both have a critical chop card. Cathy has a safe discard.
  - Alice and Bob both have one known playable card in their hand.
  - So, if Alice plays, Bob will perform a _Generation Discard_, and discard a critical card. This is not an option.
  - Therefore, Alice must discard. This is a _Scream Discard_ to Bob, and he should _Chop Move_. It is also a _Generation Discard_ to Cathy, and she should not _Chop Move_.

### The Rebellious Discard

- First, see the section on the _[Scream Discard](level-6.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)_.
- Part of the _Scream Discard_ convention states that after a _Scream Discard_, the next player **cannot** discard. Thus, a player in this situation must completely waste a clue if there is nothing productive to do.
- However, in some situations, the player who has been screamed at sees that if they give a clue, the next player will be left at 0 clues and will be forced to discard a critical card.
- Thus, in this situation, the player should _Chop Move_ as normal and then discard their new chop. This second _Scream Discard_ is called a _Rebellious Discard_, because they are not doing what they are told.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 4 is in the discard pile.
  - There are 0 clues available.
  - Alice has a known-playable blue 2.
  - Bob has a critical red 4 on chop. Bob has no playable cards in his hand.
  - Cathy's hand is _Locked_. All of the cards in Cathy's hand are critical. None of these cards are playable.
  - Alice looks into the future and sees that if she plays the blue 2, Bob will be forced to discard the critical red 4, since the team is currently at 0 clues.
  - Thus, Alice performs a _Scream Discard_, discarding instead of playing the known-playable blue 2.
  - Bob knows that Alice performed a _Scream Discard_, so he marks his chop card as _Chop Moved_.
  - Bob also knows that, as per the _Scream Discard_ rules, he is not allowed to discard on this turn, and must give some clue instead (in case he has two critical cards in a row).
  - However, in this case, if Bob did that, then Bob would be using the last clue, and then Cathy would not have a clue available and would be forced to discard a critical card.
  - Thus, Bob knows that he must perform a _Rebellious Discard_ in order to provide a clue for Cathy to do something.
