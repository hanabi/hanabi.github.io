## Conventions

### The Double Bluff (DB)

- Sometimes, you see that two players in a row have playable *Finesse Position* cards. However, they are unrelated, so you can't get them both played with a *Double Finesse*. In this situation, by performing a clue that looks like a *Finesse* or a *Bluff* which resolves after two blind-plays instead of one, you can get both cards played.
- Like with *Bluffs*, if the type of clue does not connect to **Both** blind-played cards, all players should realize that a double bluff has occurred, and not attempt to blind-play any more cards.
- Also like with *Bluffs*, *Double Bluffs* may only be performed from *Bluff Seat*, and must be demonstrated immediately. In other words, both blind-plays must occur on the two turns directly following the clue.
- A *Double Bluff* is possible with any good touched card which is not yet playable (Note that this is only if, for example, the *5 Color Ejection* and *5 Number Discharge* from future levels do not apply). Thus, the clue recipient should be very careful to note down all possibilities that explain the two blind-plays that she observed. First, she should note all possibilities that would compel the first *Double Bluffed* player to respond by playing his *First Finesse Position*. Then, she should erase all possibilities that would not cause the second *Double Bluffed* player to blind-play, namely, any possibilities for a true finesse not requiring their contribution, and any valid *Bluffs*.
- There are many different types of *Double Bluffs*, and some examples are given below.

<br />

### The Double Half Bluff (DHB)

- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Donald red, which touches a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob goes next and assumes that it is a *Double Self-Finesse* - he has the red 2 and red 3 in his two newest slots. Thus, he blind-plays his left-most and it is red 2, as expected.
  - Cathy goes next. Cathy sees that Bob does **not** have red 3 in his *Second Finesse Position* (and no one else has a red 3 in their *Finesse Position* either). Thus, Cathy must have the red 3. Cathy tries to blind-play red 3 from her *Finesse Position*, but is blue 1 instead.
  - Bob now knows he does not have the red 3 anymore, since Cathy blind-played.
  - Cathy now knows that since two blind-plays happened in a row, she does **not** have the red 3 and that she was *Bluffed*.
  - At first, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 2 (as a *Play Clue*).
  - After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 3 (as a *Finesse*).
  - After Cathy blind-played, Donald knows that his card was not a valid *Finesse* target for the red 2, and so he must have the red 4 (as a *Double Half Bluff*)
  - (Donald knows that it cannot be a red 5, or else Bob would have blind-played his *Second Finesse Position* due to *5 Color Ejection*.)

<br />

### The Double Total Bluff

- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Red 1 is currently played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Donald red, which touches a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Since red 4 must be playable right now, Bob thinks he has the red 2 and the red 3. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card, but it is actually a blue 1.
  - Cathy sees that Bob blind-played because of the red clue. However, since the red 4 is a two-away from playable card instead of a *one-away-from-playable* card, it must mean that it is a *Double Bluff* instead of a single *Bluff*. Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card and it is yellow 1.
  - At first, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 2 (as a *Play Clue*).
  - After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 3 (as a *Bluff*).
  - After Cathy blind-played, Donald knows that his card was not a valid *Bluff* target for the blue 1, and so he must have the red 4 (as a *Double Total Bluff*)
  - (Donald knows that it cannot be a red 5, or else Bob would have blind-played his *Second Finesse Position* due to *5 Color Ejection*.)

### The Triple Bluff (Illegal)

- A *Double Bluff* is when a player clues a card that is two-away-from-playable and it gets two unrelated cards to blind-play from *Finesse Position*.
- Logically, it follows from the *Double Bluff* that if a player clues a card that is three-away-from-playable, it would cause three unrelated cards to blind-play from *Finesse Position* as a *Triple Bluff*.
- However, this is not the case. We explicitly agree that *Triple Bluffs* are illegal and not to be used. (*Triple One-Third Bluffs* and *Triple Two-Third Bluffs* are also illegal.)
- The consequence of this is that if a player gives a *Play Clue* to a three-away-from-playable card (e.g. either a 4 or a 5) and it causes two cards to blind-play, then the next player should **not** continue to blind-play any more cards. See the next section for more information.

<br />

### The 4 Double Bluff & The 5 Double Bluff

- Since *Triple Bluffs* are illegal and not to be used, it is possible to perform a *Double Bluff* with a card that is not exactly two-away-from-playable. This is similar to how the *3 Bluff* convention works.
- This is how it works for 4's:
  - If a 4 is given a *Play Clue* and it is *one-away-from-playable*, then it would only trigger a single *Bluff* (and not a *Double Bluff*).
  - If a 4 is given a *Play Clue* and it is *two-away-from-playable*, then it would trigger a *Double Bluff*. (This would be a "normal" *Double Bluff*.)
  - If a 4 is given a *Play Clue* and it is *three-away-from-playable*, then it would still only trigger a double *Bluff* (as a *4's Double Bluff* specifically).
- This is how it works for 5's:
  - If a 5 is given a *Play Clue* and it is *one-away-from-playable*, then it would only trigger a single *Bluff* (and not a *Double Bluff*).
  - If a 5 is given a *Play Clue* and it is *two-away-from-playable*, then it would trigger a *Double Bluff*. (This would be a "normal" *Double Bluff*.)
    - Note that this would only happen if e.g. *5 Color Ejection* and *5 Number Discharge* would not apply. (These are advanced conventions that are covered in later levels.)
  - If a 5 is given a *Play Clue* and it is *three-away-from-playable* or *four-away-from-playable*, then it would still only trigger a double *Bluff* (as a *5's Double Bluff* specifically).
    - Note that this would only happen if e.g. *5 Color Ejection* and *5 Number Discharge* would not apply. (These are advanced conventions that are covered in later levels.)
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Donald red, which touches a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob tries to blind-play red 1 from his *Finesse Position*, but he instead plays a blue 1.
  - Cathy knows that this must be a *Double Bluff*. She blind-plays yellow 1 from her *Finesse Position*.
  - Now, it is Donald's turn.
    - At first, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 1 (as a *Play Clue*).
    - After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was either a red 2 (as a *Bluff*) or a red 3 (as a *3 Bluff*).
    - After Cathy blind-played, Donald now knows that the red card in his hand is a red 4 (as a *4's Double Bluff*).
    - (Donald knows that it cannot be a red 5, or else Bob would have blind-played his *Second Finesse Position* due to *5 Color Ejection*.)

### The 4 Double Bluff That Looks like a Double Half Bluff

- Because any *Bluff* sequence that gets two cards blind-played can be a 4, this means that players have to account for the fact that a card that initiates a *Double Half Bluff* could also be a 4.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays red 1.
  - Cathy blind-plays blue 1.
  - At first, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 1 (as a *Play Clue*).
  - After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 2 (as a *Finesse*).
  - After Cathy blind-played, Donald knows that his card was not a valid *Finesse* target for the red 1, and so he must have the red 3 or red 4 (as a *Double Half Bluff* or as a *4 Double Bluff*).
  - (Donald knows that it cannot be a red 5, or else Bob would have blind-played his *Second Finesse Position* due to *5 Color Ejection*.)

### The Hard 4 Double Bluff

- Similar to a *Hard 3 Bluff*, it is also possible to perform a *Hard 4 Double Bluff*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - No cards are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Donald, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays red 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy blind-plays red 2 from her *Finesse Position*.
  - Even though red 1 and red 2 are the same suit as the red 4, the team knows that no-one is promised the red 3, since two blind-plays happened immediately after the clue.
  - Donald knows that his clued card can be any 4.

### The Hard 5 Double Bluff

- Similar to a *Hard 3 Bluff* and a *Hard 4 Double Bluff*, it is also possible to perform a *Hard 5 Double Bluff*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
   - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays red 2 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy blind-plays red 3 from her *Finesse Position*.
  - Even though red 2 and red 3 are the same suit as the red 5, the team knows that no-one is promised the red 4, since two blind-plays happened immediately after the clue.
  - Donald initially marks his card as a red, yellow, green or blue 5, since any of these will get Bob to play slot 1. However, since Cathy blind-played, the card must not have been a valid bluff target for the red 2; therefore, he erases the two possibilities and notes his 5 as red or yellow.

<br />

### The Double Bluff That Looks Like Two Finesses

- Sometimes, a *Double Bluff* can be initiated with a card that is *one-away-from-playable*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues 2 to Donald, touching a red 2 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays yellow 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy sees that red 2, clued with a rank clue, connects to the yellow 1 but is not a valid finesse target for it. Therefore, this must be a double bluff, and she blind-plays green 1 from her *Finesse Position*.
  - At first, Donald thought that the 2 in his hand was yellow or green 2 (as a *Finesse* on either Bob or Cathy).
  - After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that the 2 in his hand was yellow 2 (as a *Finesse* on Bob).
  - After Cathy blind-played, Donald knows that this was a *Double Bluff*. He first marks his 2 as a red, yellow, blue or purple 2, since any of those would cause Bob to blind-play. He then erases the yellow note, since Cathy's blind-play indicates that the 2 is not a valid finesse target for the yellow 1.

### Double Bluffs in Rainbow Variants

- The range of notes on the clued card can be much greater when a *Double Bluff* is performed in certain variants.
- For example, in a 4-player Rainbow (6 Suits) game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues blue to Donald, touching a rainbow 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays blue 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy sees that rainbow 3, clued with a color clue, connects to the blue 1 but is not a valid finesse target for it. Therefore, this must be a double bluff, and she blind-plays yellow 1 from her *Finesse Position*.
  - At first, Donald thought that the blue card in his hand was a rainbow or blue 1 (as a *Play Clue*).
  - After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that the blue card in his hand was blue 2 (as a *Finesse*).
  - After Cathy blind-played, Donald knows that this was a *Double Bluff*. He first marks his blue card as blue 2, blue 3, blue 4, rainbow 2, rainbow 3, rainbow 4, since any of those would cause Bob to blind-play. He then erases the blue 2 note, since Cathy's blind-play indicates that the blue card is not a valid finesse target for the yellow 1.
  - (Donald knows that it cannot be a blue or rainbow 5, or else Bob would have blind-played his *Second Finesse Position* due to *5 Color Ejection*.)

## General Principles

<br />

### Deferring a Bluff

- From *Urgency Principle*, we know that players are allowed to defer a *Finesse* or a *Bluff* in order to do a *Finesse* or *Bluff* of their own. And indeed, when players see a really good clue, they should probably defer blind-playing to give the clue. But there are limits.
- When a player knows for sure that they are *Finessed* (instead of *Bluffed*), then deferring a *Finesse* (to perform another *Finesse* or *Bluff*) is great! It has almost no downsides, other than the obvious loss of *Tempo*. Everyone on the team is "in the know", so to speak.
- When a player *could* be *Bluffed*, deferring a *Bluff* can be extremely dangerous because it causes *Information Desynchronization* throughout the team.
- Deferring a *Bluff* to perform a *Finesse* can be pretty clear, depending on the situation. It should be done sparingly.
  - Note that deferring a *Bluff* to perform a *Finesse* can potentially lose the game if the original cluer is performing a *Double Half Bluff*. So there is some risk involved.
- Deferring a *Bluff* to perform **another** *Bluff* is much worse. Since the *Bluff* was not immediately resolved, the game state "fractures" into two valid game states for the receivers of each clue (e.g. the player who received the clue that initiated the first *Bluff*, and the player who received the clue that initiated the *Deferred Bluff*). This means that these two players will have to entertain two entire hypothetical game states in their mind and build upon each hypothetical with each new piece of information. This makes it extremely difficult for them to plan ahead or make correct decisions during their turns.
- Thus, deferring a *Bluff* to do another *Bluff* should **almost never be performed**.
- Also, see the below section on *Deferring a Double Bluff*.

<br />

### Deferring a Double Bluff

- First, see the section on *[Deferring a Bluff](#deferring-a-bluff)*.
- If Bob suspects that Alice is performing a *Double Bluff*, then Bob should **never defer**. It is very important that *Double Bluffs* resolve immediately.
- Similarly, if Bob blind-plays, and Cathy can not rule out a *Double Bluff*, then Cathy should **never defer**. (If Cathy defers, it will cause an unrecoverable *Information Desynchronization*, because her future blind-play will not be interpreted as related to the *Double Bluff*.)

<br />
