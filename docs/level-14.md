## Special Moves

### The Double Bluff

- Sometimes, Bob and Cathy will have playable cards on their *Finesse Position*. In this situation, you might be able to perform a *Double Finesse* to get them to immediately blind-play. However, this is only possible if both cards are related, and the "connecting" card is available to *Play Clue*.
- In the same way that you can sometimes perform a *Bluff* when a *Finesse* is not available, you can also sometimes perform a *Double Bluff* when a *Double Finesse* is not available. This is performed by giving a *Play Clue* to non-trash card that not not a legal *Bluff*-target.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Red 1 is currently played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Donald red, which touches a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Since red 4 must be playable right now, Bob thinks he has the red 2 and the red 3. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card, but it is actually a blue 1.
  - Cathy sees that Bob blind-played because of the red clue. However, the red 4 is a non-trash card and not a legal *Bluff*-target. Thus, Alice must intend for a *Double Bluff* instead of a single *Bluff*. Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card and it is a yellow 1.
  - At first, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 2 (as a *Play Clue*).
  - After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 3 (as a *Bluff*).
  - After Cathy blind-played, Donald knows that his card was not a valid *Bluff* target for the blue 1, and so he must have the red 4 (as a *Double Bluff*).
    - For players not yet at level 15, Donald would also mark the card as a potential red 5 in addition to a red 4.

- Similar to other kinds of *Bluffs*, *Double Bluffs* may only be performed from *Bluff Seat*, and must be demonstrated immediately. In other words, both blind-plays must occur on the two turns directly following the clue.
- Some more-specific types of *Double Bluffs* are listed below.

<br />

### The Triple Bluff (Illegal)

- We agree that all *Bluff*-style clues should resolve after two-blind plays.
- Thus, there is no such thing as a *Triple Bluff*.

<br />

### The Hard Double Bluff

- Similar to a *Hard 3 Bluff*, it is also possible to perform a *Hard Double Bluff*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - No cards are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Donald, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays red 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy blind-plays red 2 from her *Finesse Position*.
  - Even though red 1 and red 2 are the same suit as the red 4, the team knows that no-one is promised the red 3, since two blind-plays happened immediately after the clue.
  - Donald knows that his clued card can be any 4.

### The Double Bluff That Looks Like Two Finesses

- Sometimes, a *Double Bluff* can be initiated with a card that is *one-away-from-playable*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues 2 to Donald, touching a red 2 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays yellow 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy sees that red 2, clued with a rank clue, connects to the yellow 1 but is not a valid finesse target for it. Therefore, this must be a double bluff, and she blind-plays green 1 from her *Finesse Position*.
  - At first, Donald thought that the 2 in his hand was yellow or green 2 (as a *Finesse* on either Bob or Cathy).
  - After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that the 2 in his hand was yellow 2 (as a *Finesse* on Bob).
  - After Cathy blind-played, Donald knows that this was a *Double Bluff*. He first marks his 2 as a red, yellow, blue or purple 2, since any of those would cause Bob to blind-play. He then erases the yellow note, since Cathy's blind-play indicates that the 2 is not a valid finesse target for the yellow 1.

### Double Bluffs in Rainbow Variants

- The range of notes on the clued card can be much greater when a *Double Bluff* is performed in certain variants.
- For example, in a 4-player Rainbow (6 Suits) game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues blue to Donald, touching a rainbow 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob blind-plays blue 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - Cathy sees that the rainbow 3 was clued with a color clue, but it does not connect to the blue 1. Thus, the rainbow 3 is not a valid *Finesse*-target. Therefore, this must be a *Double Bluff*.
  - Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position*. It is a yellow 1 and it successfully plays.
  - At first, Donald thought that the blue card in his hand was a rainbow or blue 1 (as a *Play Clue*).
  - After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that the blue card in his hand was blue 2 (as a *Finesse*).
  - After Cathy blind-played, Donald knows that this was a *Double Bluff*. He first marks his blue card as blue 2, blue 3, blue 4, rainbow 2, rainbow 3, rainbow 4, since any of those would cause Bob to blind-play. He then erases the blue 2 note, since Cathy's blind-play indicates that the blue card is not a valid finesse target for the yellow 1.
  - (Donald knows that it cannot be a blue or rainbow 5, or else Bob would have blind-played his *Second Finesse Position* due to *5 Color Ejection*.)

## General Principles

<br />

### Deferring a Bluff

- From *Urgency Principle*, we know that players are allowed to defer a *Finesse* or a *Bluff* in order to do a *Finesse* or *Bluff* of their own. And indeed, when players see a really good clue, they should probably defer blind-playing to give the clue. But there are limits.
- When a player knows for sure that they are *Finessed* (instead of *Bluffed*), then deferring a *Finesse* (to perform another *Finesse* or *Bluff*) is great! It has almost no downsides, other than the obvious loss of *Tempo*. Everyone on the team is "in the know", so to speak.
- When a player *could* be *Bluffed*, deferring a *Bluff* can be extremely dangerous because it causes *Information Desynchronization* throughout the team.
- Deferring a *Bluff* to perform a *Finesse* can be pretty clear, depending on the situation. It should be done sparingly.
  - Note that deferring a *Bluff* to perform a *Finesse* can potentially lose the game if the original cluer is performing a *Double Half Bluff*. So there is some risk involved.
- Deferring a *Bluff* to perform **another** *Bluff* is much worse. Since the *Bluff* was not immediately resolved, the game state "fractures" into two valid game states for the receivers of each clue (e.g. the player who received the clue that initiated the first *Bluff*, and the player who received the clue that initiated the *Deferred Bluff*). This means that these two players will have to entertain two entire hypothetical game states in their mind and build upon each hypothetical with each new piece of information. This makes it extremely difficult for them to plan ahead or make correct decisions during their turns.
- Thus, deferring a *Bluff* to do another *Bluff* should **almost never be performed**.
- Also, see the below section on *Deferring a Double Bluff*.

<br />

### Deferring a Double Bluff

- First, see the section on *[Deferring a Bluff](#deferring-a-bluff)*.
- If Bob suspects that Alice is performing a *Double Bluff*, then Bob should **never defer**. It is very important that *Double Bluffs* resolve immediately.
- Similarly, if Bob blind-plays, and Cathy can not rule out a *Double Bluff*, then Cathy should **never defer**. (If Cathy defers, it will cause an unrecoverable *Information Desynchronization*, because her future blind-play will not be interpreted as related to the *Double Bluff*.)

| Double Bluff (second blind-player) | Finesse      | No, **never** do this
