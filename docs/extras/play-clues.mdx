### The Negative 5's Tempo Clue (or Inverted 5's Tempo Clue)

- Normally, if a color clue "fills in" a 5 (that was previously touched), and the clue touches no other cards in the hand, then it is obviously focused on the 5 - the 5 is playable right now.
- However, as a special exception, if doing so makes _another_ 5 in that player's hand known to be playable, then the clue is said to be focused on the other 5, making the original card clued **not** playable right now.
- If a _Negative 5's Tempo Clue_ only gets one card played, then it would also be a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_.

### The Continuation Clue (Touching Both Inside and Outside a Layer)

- Sometimes, a player who is blind-playing cards into a _Layered Finesse_ receives another clue that touches cards **both** inside the layer and outside the layer.
- By default, the player should assume that it is another normal _Play Clue_ or _Save Clue_ on a card outside of the layer, and **continue** to blind-play cards. This follows from _Information Lock Principle_. _Play Clues_ given in this manner are called _Continuation Clues_.
- Because _Continuation Clues_ are the default interpretation, it can be difficult to give a _Fix Clue_, since a _Fix Clue_ must **only** touch cards inside of the layer.
