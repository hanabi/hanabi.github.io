### The Continuation Clue (Touching Both Inside and Outside a Layer)

- Sometimes, a player who is blind-playing cards into a _Layered Finesse_ receives another clue that touches cards **both** inside the layer and outside the layer.
- By default, the player should assume that it is another normal _Play Clue_ or _Save Clue_ on a card outside of the layer, and **continue** to blind-play cards. This follows from _Information Lock Principle_. _Play Clues_ given in this manner are called _Continuation Clues_.
- Because _Continuation Clues_ are the default interpretation, it can be difficult to give a _Fix Clue_, since a _Fix Clue_ must **only** touch cards inside of the layer.
