### The Negative 5's Tempo Clue (or Inverted 5's Tempo Clue)

- Normally, if a color clue "fills in" a 5 (that was previously touched), and the clue touches no other cards in the hand, then it is obviously focused on the 5 - the 5 is playable right now.
- However, as a special exception, if doing so makes _another_ 5 in that player's hand known to be playable, then the clue is said to be focused on the other 5, making the original card clued **not** playable right now.
- Since _Negative 5's Tempo Clues_ only get one card played, they are also _Tempo Clue Chop Moves_ like most other _Tempo Clue_.

### The Double Tempo Clue Inversion (Immediate Double Clue)

- If a player is clued the exact same thing twice before it gets to be their turn, it means that they can play **all** of the cards that the clue touched, but in the opposite order than normal (right-to-left, since you would normally play cards from left-to-right).
  - If one of the cards includes the chop card, it means to play all of the cards from 2nd oldest to newest, and then the chop last.
- If you are re-clued about a bunch of cards after you have already taken a turn, see the _Double Tempo Clue_ section.

### The Continuation Clue (Touching Both Inside and Outside a Layer)

- Sometimes, a player who is blind-playing cards into a _Layered Finesse_ receives another clue that touches cards **both** inside the layer and outside the layer.
- By default, the player should assume that it is another normal _Play Clue_ or _Save Clue_ on a card outside of the layer, and **continue** to blind-play cards. This follows from _Information Lock Principle_. _Play Clues_ given in this manner are called _Continuation Clues_.
- Because _Continuation Clues_ are the default interpretation, it can be difficult to give a _Fix Clue_, since a _Fix Clue_ must **only** touch cards inside of the layer.
