These are _Finesses_ that are triggered by performing a suboptimal clue or by picking a strange choice for a clue.

<br />

### The Suboptimal Prompt & The Suboptimal Finesse & The Suboptimal Bluff

- The _Suboptimal Finesse_ is covered at [level 21](../level-21.mdx#the-suboptimal-prompt--the-suboptimal-finesse--the-suboptimal-bluff).

<br />

### The Declined 5's Finesse

- The _5's Chop Move_ is typically used to save a 5 and a critical non-5 at the same time. This is very efficient, because it saves both cards with one clue instead of having to spend two clues.
- So, when a player has this strategy available, but instead declines to do it and clues the critical card on chop directly (without touching any other cards), then this is quite strange.
- In this situation, the player must be trying to communicate something extra. Similar to an _Occupied Finesse_, the player is trying to signal that this seemingly innocent _Save Clue_ is actually a _Play Clue_ instead. Someone on the team must have the cards to make this critical card playable.
- In some situations, the blind-player may have to defer playing into the _Finesse_ and instead give a _5 Save_ to the player with the (now) unsafe chop. If they do, then this is not a problem - the clue receiver can retroactively determine that a _Declined 5's Finesse_ has occurred and should not _stomp_ on the _Finesse_.

### The Rank Choice Save Finesse

- When saving a card, players have to choose carefully between using a color clue or a rank clue. However, in some rare situations, it makes absolutely no difference which clue is used:
  - Both color and rank would only touch the specific card.
  - Both color and rank would communicate the exact identity of the specific card.
  - Both color and rank would not give any useful negative information to the other cards in the hand.
- In these situations, the player giving the clue has a completely free choice between rank and color. We agree that by default, players should use color to save the card.
- If players instead use a rank clue to save the card, this communicates a _Rank Choice Save Finesse_.
