- A *Charm* refers to a blind-play in which someone plays an unrelated card from their *Fourth Finesse Position*. For example, if a player's hand is completely unclued, their *Fourth Finesse Position* is slot 4.
- _Charms_ fall outside of the _Signal Shift_ framework. Instead, playing from _Fourth Finesse Position_ is required in order to disambiguate the clue from being a _Finesse_, _Ejection_, or _Discharge_.
- Just like a *Bluff*, a *Charm* can only be performed on the very next player.

### The 4 Charm

- The _4 Charm_ is introduced at [level 24](../level-24.mdx#the-4-charm).

#### Interaction with Double Bluffs Where Cathy Has a One-Away-From-Playable Card

- As stated in the level 24 section, _Double Bluffs_ have precedence over _4 Charms_. However, there is one small exception.
- _Double Bluffs_ do not have precedence in the situation where Bob sees that Cathy has a _one-away-from-playable_ card on her _Finesse Position_.
- Here, it is technically possible that Bob will blind-play the exact card that makes Cathy's _Finesse Position_ playable. But since this is so unlikely, we agree that players in this situation should revert to a _4 Charm_ interpretation if Bob has a _Fourth Finesse Position_ and the requirements for a _4 Charm_ are met.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues blue to Donald, touching a blue 4 as a _Play Clue_. (Blue 4 is currently three-away-from-playable.)
  - Bob sees that Cathy has a red 3 on her _Finesse Position_.
  - If Bob has exactly a red 2 on his _Finesse Position_, then he knows that Alice's clue would work as a _4's Double Bluff_.
  - However, since the red 3 on Cathy's _Finesse Position_ is _one-away-from-playable_, Bob knows that _4 Charms_ should take precedence.
  - Bob blind-plays his _Fourth Finesse Position_ card.

- Even when Cathy's card is one-away-from-playable, there are still some situations in which a _4 Charm_ is invalid, and therefore a _Double Bluff_ can still be executed. Two such situations are described below.
  - In the case where Bob does not have a _Fourth Finesse Position_, then a _4 Charm_ does not make sense. Hence, a _Double Bluff_ can still be triggered in this case.
  - For example, in a four-player game:
    - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
    - Bob and Cathy have a red 1 and red 2 on their _Finesse Position_, respectively.
    - Alice clues 4 to Donald, focusing a green 4.
    - Bob sees Donald has a green 2 on _Finesse Position_. Thus, the green 4 is only two away and a _4 Charm_ is not legal.
    - Bob therefore blind-plays his _Finesse Position_.
    - Cathy sees that the green 4 was more than one-away-from-playable, and hence was not a valid _Bluff Target_ for a single _Bluff_. So, Cathy also blind-plays her _Finesse Position_.
    - Donald marks his 4 as any 4.

#### Interaction with the Out-of-Order Finesse

- First, see the section on the _[Out-of-Order Finesse](../level-21.mdx#the-out-of-order-finesse)_.
- The _Out-of-Order Finesse_ always takes precedence over a _4 Charm_ or a _4's Double Bluff_, because of _Bob's Truth Principle_.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Donald's hand is as follows, from left to right: `red 4, red 1, blue 3, blue 3`
  - Alice clues red to Donald, touching the red 4 on slot 1 and the red 1 on slot 2. This is a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that this could be the truth as an _Out-of-Order Finesse_. If that is the case, he should clue number 4 to Donald, allowing him to play the red 1. Then, Bob can blind-play the red 2 and the red 3 (into the playable red 4).
  - Bob knows that this could also be a _4 Charm_, since the red 4 is _three-away-from-playable_ and Bob does not see any other red cards on _Finesse Position_.
  - However, Bob knows that he should always assume the truth over a lie, so he assumes that Alice intends for an _Out-of-Order Finesse_.

### The Unknown Trash Charm (UTC)

- First, see the section on the _[Unknown Trash Discharge](../level-16.mdx#the-unknown-trash-discharge-1-for-1-form-utd)_.
- Normally, after an _Unknown Trash Discharge_, non-focused cards are known to be "good".
- However, what if a player performs an _Unknown Trash Discharge_ where **all** of the non-focused cards are trash? A _Discharge_ would incorrectly signal that the non-focused cards are useful.
- Instead, this should signal a _Charm_ on the very next player.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1 on slot 1 and a red 2 on slot 2.
  - Normally, Bob would treat this clue as an _Unknown Trash Discharge_. However, if he _Discharges_, then Cathy will discard the red 1 and mark the red 2 as either a red 3, a red 4, or a red 5, which would be a _Lie_.
  - Instead, Bob knows that this signals an _Unknown Trash Charm_, so he blind-plays his _Fourth Finesse Position_. It is a blue 3 and it successfully plays.

### The Junk Charm (for 1's)

- Sometimes, when giving a number 1 _Play Clue_ for 1's, a _Bad Touch_ is unavoidable. But what if a player does this when a color clue would have avoided a _Bad Touch_?
- If all the non-focused 1's are trash, the clue must be calling for something extra - a _Charm_ on the very next player.
- After the _Charm_ occurs, the clued player will know that **only** the focus of the 1's clue is playable.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Green 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a red 1 on slot 5 and a green 1 on slot 2.
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: `yellow 2, green 1, blue 3, purple 5, red 1`
  - Bob can see that Alice could have clued red to only touch the red 1 and avoid a _Bad Touch_.
  - Bob knows that this signals a blind-play:
    - A _Finesse Position_ blind-play would look like a _Trash Finesse_, which would be a _Lie_.
    - A _Second Finesse Position_ blind-play would look like a _Trash Push Ejection_, which would be a _Lie_.
    - A _Third Finesse Position_ blind-play would look like a _Unknown Trash Discharge, which would be a \_Lie_.
  - Thus, Bob knows this must be a _Junk Charm_ and blind-plays his _Fourth Finesse Position_. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
