### Self Color Bluffs (1-for-1 Form) (SCB)

- It is possible (and fairly common) to perform a _Self-Bluff_ on a player with a rank clue.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Bob, which touches one new 4 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob does not see any playable cards in anyone else's hand.
  - The closest 4 to being playable is the red 4, so Bob knows that the 4 in his hand is probably a red 4.
  - Since Bob does not see any red 3's, Bob knows he must have the red 3, and he blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card. It is a blue 1 and successfully plays.
  - Bob now knows that he was _Bluffed_ by Alice and that the 4 in his hand is exactly red 4.

<SelfColorBluff />

- Doing a _Self-Bluff_ on a player with a color clue is a bit more weird. On the face of it, a _Self Color Bluff_ would be nonsensical, since the receiving player would have negative color on the card that they are blind-playing - they would explicitly know that the blind-card cannot possibly "connect".
- Nonetheless, we agree that in this situation, players should blind-play a card anyway as a _Known Bluff_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which "fills in" a card with a number 4 clue on it. It is now a globally-known red 4.
  - This must be a _Play Clue_ on the red 4, since Alice is not in a stalling situation. (If Alice was in a stalling situation, then she would be allowed to give a "fill-in" clue without anything special happening.)
  - Bob does not see any red cards in other player's hands, so it cannot be a _Prompt_ or a _Reverse Finesse_.
  - Bob cannot possibly have the red 3 in his _Finesse Position_, because that card has negative red.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this must be a _Self Color Bluff_, so he blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card as a _Known Bluff_ on any playable non-red card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.

<SelfColorBluff2 />

- Note that _Self Color Bluffs_ should not be confused with the more-ordinary "fill-in" clues that are used in stalling situations. (See the [Allowable Stall Clues](../level-9.mdx#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table) section.) In other words, **if someone could be in a stalling situation, you should never blind-play a card from a fill-in clue**.
- _Self Color Bluffs_ are not very good and should only be used sparingly, because:
  - they can be confusing
  - they almost always have an efficiency of a 1-for-1
- Expert players can use _Self Color Bluffs_ as a nice alternative to giving a 1-for-1 directly to the card in _Finesse Position_. Doing so has the advantage of "filling in" an ancillary card in the hand.
- More examples of a _Self Color Bluff_ can be found [here](../examples/self-color-bluff.mdx).

<br />

### Self Color Bluff (2-for-1 Form) (SCB)

- Rarely, it is also possible to perform a _Self Color Bluff_ as a 2-for-1.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which touches a new red card on his slot 2.
  - This must be a _Play Clue_ on the red card.
  - Bob has a negative 3 clue on his red card, so he knows it cannot possibly be a red 3 (the next playable red card).
  - Bob does not see any red cards in other player's hands, so it cannot be a _Prompt_ or a _Reverse Finesse_.
  - Bob cannot possibly have the red 3 in his _Finesse Position_, because that card now has negative red.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this must be a _Self Color Bluff_, so he blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card as a _Known Bluff_ on any playable non-red card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Bob marks his red card as a red 4 (since that is the red card that is _one-away-from-playable_).

<SelfColorBluff3 />

### Self Color Double Bluff (SCDB)

- Just like normal bluffs, _Self Color Bluffs_ are done by "filling in" a card that is _one-away-from-playable_ or a legal _Bluff_ target.
- However, players can also perform a _Self Color Double Bluff_ by "filling in" a card that is _two-or-more-away-from-playable_ and not a legal _Bluff_ target.
- For example, in a 3-player game (similar to the previous example):
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which touches a new red card on his slot 2.
  - This must be a _Play Clue_ on the red card, since Alice is not in a stalling situation. (If Alice was in a stalling situation, then she would be allowed to give a "fill-in" clue without anything special happening.)
  - Bob has a negative 3 clue on his red card, so he knows it cannot possibly be a red 3 (the next playable red card).
  - Bob does not see any red cards in other player's hands, so it cannot be a _Prompt_ or a _Reverse Finesse_.
  - Bob cannot possibly have the red 3 in his _Finesse Position_, because that card now has negative red.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this must be a _Self Color Bluff_, so he blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card as a _Known Bluff_ on any playable non-red card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Bob marks his red card as a red 4 (since that is the red card that is _one-away-from-playable_).
  - Cathy sees that Alice did a _Self Color Bluff_ on Bob. However, Cathy sees that the red card in Bob's hand is the red 5, which is _two-away-from-playable_. That means that Alice means to perform a _Self Color Double Bluff_ (instead of a single _Bluff_).
  - Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card as a _Known Bluff_. It is a blue 2 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Bob is surprised by Cathy's blind-play and realizes that it must be related to the clue that Alice gave. If Bob had a red 4 in his hand, then Cathy would not have gone on to blind-play anything. So, Bob erases his note of "red 4" and instead writes "red 5", because that is the only red card that is _two-away-from-playable_, and is the only card that would make Cathy blind-play.

- More examples of a _Self Color Double Bluff_ can be found [here](../examples/self-color-double-bluff.mdx).

### Queued Bluffs (Exception)

- First, see the section explaining that [_Queued Bluffs_ are illegal](../level-11.mdx#queued-bluffs-illegal).
- Rarely, a player can know that a _Layered Finesse_ is impossible. This could be because they know the identity of every card in their hand (minus their _Finesse Position_ card). Or, alternatively, they could have relevant negative information on their entire hand.
- If the player can rule out a _Layered Finesse_, then it is possible to perform a _Queued Bluff_ on them. It is important to note that such a player is "locked in" to the _Bluff_ and should almost always immediately play their _Finesse Position_ card.

<br />

### The Elimination Bluff & The Elimination Layered Finesse

- Normally, if a player has _Elimination Notes_ on their hand, you can clue the next card in the suit to perform an _Elimination Finesse_.
- It is also possible to pretend like you are performing an _Elimination Finesse_ on someone in order to get an unrelated card to blind-play from their oldest slot.
- If the player who performed the clue was in _Bluff Seat_, then it is to be treated like a _Bluff_, and thus they will not know where the actual _Elimination Card_ is. (However, in most cases, at this point there will only be one remaining card with an _Elimination Note_ on it, so it won't matter.)
- If the player who performed the clue was not in _Bluff Seat_, then the blind-playing player is expected to keep playing until they find the intended card. This is similar to how a _Layered Finesse_ works, but it is inverted such that they play cards from oldest to newest.

<br />

### The Known Priority Bluff

- Players generally perform _Priority Bluffs_ by tricking players into thinking they have a specific card. However, it is also possible to perform a _Known Priority Bluff_.
- For example:
  - Alice has a three known playable cards: red 1, blue 4, and blue 5.
  - Bob has a known red 2.
  - Alice is expected to play the red 1 into the red 2, so the red 1 has _Priority_.
  - Instead, Alice plays the blue 4.
  - Normally, Bob would think that this is a _Priority Finesse_ on the blue 5. However, both he and Alice know that Alice has the blue 5.
  - This must be a _Known Priority Bluff_, so Bob plays his _Finesse Position_ card as any playable card.

<KnownPriorityBluff />

- Just like normal _Bluffs_, players are only allowed to perform a _Known Priority Bluff_ on the very next player.

<br />

### The Pestilent Triple Bluff

- First, see the section on the _[Pestilent Double Bluff](../level-15.mdx#the-pestilent-double-bluff-pdb)_.
- Normally, when cluing a non-trash card, two blind-plays is enough to for the clued player to write the correct note on the card.
- Rarely, in a 5-player game, two blind-plays is not enough, and the note is still wrong. In these cases, Alice would be intending for Donald to play as a _Pestilent Triple Bluff_.
- Note that normally, _Triple Bluffs_ are explicitly illegal. But _Pestilent Triple Bluffs_ are an exception to this rule.
- For example, in a 5-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Emily, touching a red 4 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob attempts to blind-play a red 2 from his _Finesse Position_. Instead, it is a blue 2, and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that this is probably a _4's Double Bluff_. Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ as any playable card. It is a blue 3 and it successfully plays.
  - Donald knows that Emily will go on to incorrectly think that her red 4 is a blue 4 (because Alice's clue looks like a _Double Finesse_). Thus, Alice's clue is quite strange.
  - Alice must be intending for Donald to also blind-play his _Finesse Position_ in order to "heal" the problem. Donald blind-plays his _Finesse Position_. It is a green 2 and it successfully plays.
  - At first, Emily thought that her 4 was the blue 4 (connecting to the blue 2 and the blue 3). However, if that was the case, then Donald would not have blind-played anything. Emily knows that this must be a _Pestilent Triple Bluff_, and her 4 is any other 4 than blue 4 (because Donald blind-played) and green 4 (because Bob would have waited for Donald).

### The Pass Bluff

- First, see the section on the _[Hesitation Blind-Play](../level-24.mdx#the-hesitation-blind-play)_.
- It is possible for a _Hesitation Blind-Play_ to occur without anyone intending it to happen. However, if a player intentionally tries to make a _Hesitation Blind-Play_ occur, it is called a _Pass Bluff_.
- In other words, after a _Finesse_ occurs that is directed at you, you will know that your _Finesse Position_ card is playable. If the next immediate player also has an unrelated playable card on their _Finesse Position_, you can pretend like the _Finesse_ wasn't directed at you. This will cause them to think that the _Finesse_ was directed at them, and you will get the unrelated card played for free.
- After the unrelated card is played, the next player should **not** continue to blind-play cards (as a _Layered Finesse_) because:
  - The "passing" player fulfills the real _Finesse_ on their next turn.
  - The "passing" player was in _Bluff Seat_.
- _Pass Bluffs_ rely on contextual information in order to work, so the circumstances in which you can do them are narrow.
- It is illegal for a player to perform a _Pass Bluff_ if they could be _Bluffed_. (This is because the first _Bluff_ would not resolve immediately and would violate _[Lie Principle](../level-11/#lie-principle)_.)
  - Subsequently, it is also illegal for a player to pass an _Ejection_ to the next player.

<br />

### The Double/Triple Pass Bluff

- After a player performs a _Pass Bluff_, when it becomes their turn again, if they see an unrelated playable card on the _Second Finesse Position_ of the next player, they can perform yet another _Pass Bluff_, implying that the first _Pass Bluff_ was not a _Pass Bluff_ at all and instead simply a _Layered Finesse_ or _Clandestine Finesse_.
- Then, after the unrelated card is played, the player who initiated the _Double Pass Bluff_ can go ahead and play into the real _Finesse_.
- Alternatively, if there continue to be playable cards, they can keep _Pass Bluffing_.

<br />

### The Purge Bluff (Layered Bluff)

- This convention only applies to 3-player games.
- Sometimes, a player will have a fully playable hand from left to right. In this situation, players will normally try to perform a _Layered Finesse_ in order to get all of the cards in the most efficient manner. However, a _Layered Finesse_ may not always be available.
- In extremely rare situations, it is possible to orchestrate a _Lie_ in which the player with the fully playable hand thinks that they are _Layered Finessed_ when they really do not have the connecting card. After they play their final card and it is not the connecting card, they will know that they were _Purge Bluffed_ and that nobody has the missing card.
- Care has to be taken that the other player (e.g. the player who is not _Purge Bluffed_) will understand what is going on. For example, they might think that a _Patch Finesse_ is happening. Thus, _Purge Bluffs_ can only be done in expert games where there is **no other possible interpretation for what is happening**.
- If the player blind-playing cards into a _Purge Bluff_ realizes that a _Lie_ has occurred before they finish blind-playing their entire hand, they are supposed to stop. In other words, they are **not** supposed to continue blind-playing cards as a _Known Purge Bluff_.
- Examples of a _Purge Bluff_ can be found [here](../examples/purge-bluff.mdx).
