- Nearly all clues send a distinct *Signal* about the card that is focused:
  1. *Play* the card
  1. *Save* the card
  1. *Trash* the card (rarely)
- Certain types of clues (likes *Finesses* or *Bluffs*) can result in *Information Desynchronization*. In order to resynchronize the team, normal *Finesse Position* blind-plays occur. After one or more blind-plays, the initial *Signal* will be sufficiently clarified.
- But what if a clue is given such that a *Finesse Position* blind-play will **never** clarify the *Signal*?
- In this situation, we agree that the next player should blind-play a card **other** than their regular *Finesse Position*. By doing so, they will *Shift* the original *Signal* in a fundamental way.
  - For example, in the *5 Color Ejection*, the original clue's *Signal Shifts* from a *Play* to a *Save*.
- This *Signal Shift* can take two forms: *Ejection* and *Discharge*.
- Just like a *Bluff*, all forms of *Signal Shifting* can only be performed on the very next player.

- This chart shows some existing *Signal Shift* conventions and how they relate to the three *Signals*.
