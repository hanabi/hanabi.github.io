### The Transfer Chop Move

- First, see the section on [blind playing _Chop Moved_ cards](../level-7.mdx#blind-playing-chop-moved-cards).
- Sometimes, duplicated cards are accidentally _Chop Moved_ through a mistake or through a complicated situation. When this happens, it is pointless to use a clue to "undo" the _Chop Move_ - the team can just continue to allow the player to discard normally.
- Subsequently, if someone **does** use a clue to undo the _Chop Move_, there must be a good reason. This means that the card they were about to discard is important, so the player should discard the now-known useless card and then permanently _Chop Move_ their new chop.

### The Misplay Chop Move

- Sometimes, a desirable card is on the next player's chop and it is not directly cluable. In this situation, players can cleverly use the various kinds of _Chop Moves_ in order to save the card, like the _Trash Chop Move_, _5's Chop Move_, _Tempo Clue Chop Move_, and so on.
- However, none of these _Chop Moves_ may be available to perform. In such a situation, players can _Chop Move_ the very next player by giving them a clue to make them intentionally misplay the clued card. This works in a similar way as a _Trash Chop Move_, except that:
  - the trash is not known to the player receiving the clue
  - it costs the team a strike
- If multiple cards are touched in a _Misplay Chop Move_, then:
  - All of the touched cards to the right of the focused/misplayed card should be kept. _Good Touch Principle_ applies to those cards.
  - All of the non-touched cards to the right of the focused/misplayed card should be _Chop Moved_. (This means that _Misplay Chop Moves_ work slightly differently than _Trash Chop Moves_.)
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is completely unclued. Bob also has three critical cards in a row on his chop.
  - Alice sees that it would require three separate clues to clue all of Bob's critical cards. However, Alice can obviously only give one clue.
  - Alice clues blue to Bob, touching a card in slot 1 and slot 3 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that the clue is focused on his slot 1 card. Therefore, the slot 1 card must be the blue 3. He tries to play the card, but it is actually a blue 4 and misplays.
  - Bob knows that if Alice is not making a mistake, she is communicating a _Misplay Chop Move_. Bob marks his slot 2, slot 4, and slot 5 cards as being _Chop Moved_. Additionally, Bob marks his other blue card in slot 3 as being a blue 3, a blue 4, or a blue 5. Bob's chop is now his slot 1 card.

- The _Misplay Chop Move_ is the most costly type of _Chop Move_, so it should only be performed in a situation where no other kind of _Chop Move_ would work.

### Double Order Chop Move (for 3-Player Games)

- This convention only applies to 3-player games.
- In the _Order Chop Move_, players can play 1's in a certain order to _Chop Move_ a specific player of their choosing.
- In a 4 or 5-player game, skipping over three 1's would _Chop Move_ the player three seats away. However, in a 3-player game, this would be nonsensical, since there are only 3 players in total.
- Thus, in a 3-player game, skipping over three 1's should _Double Chop Move_ the very next player.
- In the rare case where four things are skipped over, it should skip over the next player and _Double Chop Move_ the player after that.

### Spillover Chop Move

- If an _Order Chop Move_ or a _Trash Order Chop Move_ is performed, but the player who is supposed to _Chop Move_ already has every single card in their hand clued, then this is very strange.
- In this situation, the _Chop Move_ should "skip" over that player and _Chop Move_ the next person after that.

### The Negative Self-Chop Move

- If a card has negative 1, 2, 3, and 4 on it, then it is explicitly known to be a 5, while not directly clued.
- In this situation, it would be a waste of a clue for the team to clue it directly.
- Thus, the player should _Chop Move_ the card.

### The Asymmetric Chop Move Dilemma

- Sometimes, an asymmetric _Chop Move_ occurs during a game.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - During the _Early Game_, Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a 5 that is one-away-from-chop.
  - Bob does not see anything else for Alice to do, so Alice's clue is probably just a _5 Stall_.
  - However, it is also possible that Bob has a playable or savable card in his hand. If this is true, then Alice's clue would instead be an _Early 5's Chop Move_.
  - Next, Alice clues Cathy, causing Bob to blind-play a card as an _Unknown Trash Discharge_.
  - In this situation, Bob cannot determine whether or not the _Unknown Trash Discharge_ was an _Unnecessary Move_. Thus, without any other conventions, Bob is not sure where Cathy's chop card is.
- In such cases, we agree that Bob should assume that all moves are _Necessary_. This follows from _Occam's Razor_; assume the simplest possible thing is happening.
