### The Transfer Chop Move

- First, see the section on [blind playing \*Chop Moved cards](../level-7.mdx#blind-playing-chop-moved-cards).
- Sometimes, duplicated cards are accidentally _Chop Moved_ through a mistake or through a complicated situation. When this happens, it is pointless to use a clue to "undo" the _Chop Move_ - the team can just continue to allow the player to discard normally.
- Subsequently, if someone **does** use a clue to undo the _Chop Move_, there must be a good reason. This means that the card they were about to discard is important, so the player should discard the now-known useless card and then permanently _Chop Move_ their new chop.

### The Misplay Chop Move

- Sometimes, a desirable card is on the next player's chop and it is not directly cluable. In this situation, players can cleverly use the various kinds of chop moves in order to save the card (e.g. _Trash Chop Move_, _5's Chop Move_, _Tempo Clue Chop Move_, and so forth).
- However, none of these chop moves may be available to perform. In such a situation, players can _Chop Move_ a player by giving them a clue to make them intentionally misplay the clued card. This works in exactly the same way as a _Trash Chop Move_, except that it the trash is not known to the player receiving the clue (and it costs the team a strike).
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is completely unclued.
  - Alice clues Bob red, touching one card on slot 1 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob assumes that it is a red 3 and immediately plays the card. However, it is actually a red 4 and it misplays.
  - Bob knows that if Alice is not making a mistake, then she must be trying to communicate something special. Similar to a _Trash Chop Move_, Bob can reason that multiple cards in his hand are important. He marks slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 as being _Chop Moved_.

- The _Misplay Chop Move_ is the most costly type of chop move, so it should only be performed in a situation where no other kind of _Chop Move_ would work.

### Double Order Chop Move (for 3-Player Games)

- This convention only applies to 3-player games.
- In the _Order Chop Move_, players can play 1's in a certain order to _Chop Move_ a specific player of their choosing.
- In a 4 or 5-player game, skipping over three 1's would _Chop Move_ the player three seats away. However, in a 3-player game, this would be nonsensical, since there are only 3 players in total.
- Thus, in a 3-player game, skipping over three 1's should _Double Chop Move_ the very next player.
- In the rare case where four things are skipped over, it should skip over the next player and _Double Chop Move_ the player after that.

### Spillover Chop Move

- If an _Order Chop Move_ or a _Trash Order Chop Move_ is performed, but the player who is supposed to _Chop Move_ already has every single card in their hand clued, then this is very strange.
- In this situation, the _Chop Move_ should "skip" over that player and _Chop Move_ the next person after that.

### The Negative Self-Chop Move

- If a card has negative 1, 2, 3, and 4 on it, then it is explicitly known to be a 5, while not directly clued.
- In this situation, it would be a waste of a clue for the team to clue it directly.
- Thus, the player should self-chop move the card.

### The Asymmetric Chop Move Dilemma

- Sometimes, an asymmetric _Chop Move_ occurs during a game.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - During the _Early Game_, Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a 5 that is one-away-from-chop.
  - Bob does not see anything else for Alice to do, so Alice's clue is probably just a _5 Stall_.
  - However, it is also possible that Bob has a playable or savable card in his hand. If this is true, then Alice's clue would instead be an _Early 5's Chop Move_.
  - Next, Alice clues Cathy, causing Bob to blind-play a card as an _Unknown Trash Discharge_.
  - In this situation, Bob cannot determine whether or not the _Unknown Trash Discharge_ was an _Unnecessary Move_. Thus, without any other conventions, Bob is not sure where Cathy's chop card is.
- In such cases, we agree that Bob should assume that all moves are _Necessary_. This follows from _Occam's Razor_; assume the simplest possible thing is happening.
