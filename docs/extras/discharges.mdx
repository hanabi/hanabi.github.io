title: Discharges
---

- A *Discharge* refers to a _Signal Shift_ blind-play in which someone plays an unrelated card from their *Third Finesse Position*.
  - For example, if a player's hand is completely unclued, their *Third Finesse Position* is slot 3.
- Just like a *Bluff*, a *Discharge* can only be performed on the very next player.

<br />

### The Unknown Trash Discharge

- The _Unknown Trash Discharge_ is introduced at [level 16](../level-16.mdx#the-unknown-trash-discharge-1-for-1-form-utd).
- This results in a _Signal Shift_ from _Play_ --> _Trash_.

<br />

### The Unknown Dupe Discharge (UDD)

- The _Unknown Dupe Discharge_ is introduced at [level 16](../level-16.mdx#the-unknown-dupe-discharge-udd).
- This results in a _Signal Shift_ from _Play_ --> _Trash_.

<br />

### The 5 Number Discharge (5ND)

- The _5 Number Discharge_ is introduced in [level 19](../level-19.mdx#5-number-discharge-5nd).
- This results in a _Signal Shift_ from _Play_ --> _Trash_ (on the _5 Pulled_ card).

<br />

### The Trash Push Discharge

- First, see the section on the [Trash Push](../level-14.mdx#the-trash-push).
- Normally, when known-trash is touched as the focus of the clue, and the known-trash is on chop, it communicates a _Trash Push_.
- However, what if the _Trash Pushed_ card is trash? The other players can see that this clue must have some other purpose - it should signal an _Discharge_ on the very next player.
- This move is extremely similar to the _Unknown Trash Discharge_. In UTD, the focus of the clue is promised as trash. In the _Trash Push Discharge_, the _Trash Pushed_ card is promised as trash.

<br />

### The Prophetic Discharge

- First, see the section on the [Prophetic Finesse](special-finesses.mdx#the-prophetic-finesse-for-1s).
- _Prophetic Finesses_ can only be given with a number 1 clue.
- If a player tries to use a color clue to initiate a _Prophetic Finesse_, they instead intend for the next player to blind-play their _Third Finesse Position_ (like an _Unknown Trash Discharge_).
- Other than that, everything else works like a _Prophetic Finesse_ (e.g. one of the in-between players is promised to have the matching card on their _Finesse Position_).
- Unlike the _Prophetic Finesse_, the clued player should **only** treat this as _unnecessary_ move if the _Discharged_ card could have been cleanly clued.
- _Prophetic Discharges_ can only be triggered by touching **exactly one 1**.
- _Prophetic Discharges_ can only be triggered by using a color clue.
- _Prophetic Discharges_ can be _Layered_. (See the _Prophetic Finesse_ section for an example of this.)
