These are additional rules that can apply to *Ejections*, *Discharges*, and *Charms*.

<br />

### The Out-of-Position Ejection

- Normally, players are only allowed to perform an *Ejection* on the very next player (similar to a *Bluff*).
- However, if an *Ejection* is performed, and the very next player does not have a *Second Finesse Position*, then they cannot demonstrate to the team that an *Ejection* is occurring.
- In this situation, the *Ejection* is on the next player with a *Second Finesse Position*. The player being passed over knows that the next player will blind-play, so they can either discard or give an unrelated clue. After that, the next player should blind-play their card immediately to demonstrate what is going on.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's has three 5's in his hand in slot 2, slot 3, and slot 4. (They were clued with number 5 as a *5 Save* earlier on in the game.)
  - Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 5 on his slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob does not see any connecting red cards in anybody's hand. Since the red 5 is three-away-from-playable, Bob knows that this must be a *5 Color Ejection*.
  - However, Bob does not have a *Second Finesse Position*. (He only has one unclued card in his hand.)
  - Thus, Bob knows that this is an *Out-of-Position 5 Color Ejection* on Cathy.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays her *Second Finesse Position* and it successfully plays as red 2.
  - Donald knows that since Cathy blind-played her *Second Finesse Position* card, this must be a *5 Color Ejection* and that his red card is the red 5.
- Note that you are not allowed to perform *Out-of-Position Ejections* in reverse, unless it is super-obvious what is going on.
- Remember that just because *OOP Ejections* are technically legal in some situations, this does **not** mean that players should use them. Just like any other complicated move, only use *OOP Ejections* when it is super-clear to the rest of the team what is going on. Otherwise, a simpler line should be chosen.

<br />

### The Out-of-Position Discharge/Charm

- First, see the section on *[Out-of-Position Ejection](#the-out-of-position-ejection)*.
- Just like OOP *Ejection*, it is possible to do an OOP *Discharge* or an OOP *Charm* in the exact same way.

<br />

### The Stacked Ejection

- Normally, you are not allowed to perform a *Bluff* on a player that is already "loaded" with a blind-play for a *Finesse*. (This is because the next player will allow for the possibility of a *Layered Finesse*, and the *Bluff* will not resolve immediately.)
- Similarly, since *Ejections* follow most of the same rules as *Bluffs*, you are not allowed to perform an *Ejection* on a player that is already "loaded" with a blind-play for a *Finesse*.
- So, if a 5 was clued with color in this situation, the next player would assume a *Stacked Finesse* instead of a *5 Color Ejection*. Thus, they would then play the card from the original *Finesse* (or play nothing if the card from the original *Finesse* is not yet playable).
- However, what if the next player can know that a *Stacked Finesse* is impossible due to them not having enough possible cards to fulfill the *Finesse*? In this case, it would be a *Known Stacked 5 Color Ejection*.
- When this occurs, players should immediately play their *First Finesse Position* (slot 2) instead of their *Second Finesse* position (slot 3).
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks and it is the first turn of the game.
  - Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 2. This is a *Finesse* on Cathy's red 1 (in her slot 1).
  - Bob clues blue to Donald, touching a blue 5.
  - Now, it is Cathy's turn. Cathy knows that she has a playable red 1, since no-one else on the team has a red 1.
  - Additionally, Cathy might think that Bob's clue was a *Stacked Finesse* on the blue 5. However, this is impossible, because Cathy sees that no-one else on the team has any blue cards. Thus, for a *Stacked Finesse* to be the case, Cathy would have to have red 1, blue 1, blue 2, blue 3, and blue 4, and Cathy only has 4 cards in her hand (since it is a 4-player game).
  - Since a *Stacked Finesse* is impossible, Cathy knows that this must be a *Stacked 5 Color Ejection*.
  - Alice's clue *Finessed* Cathy. So after Alice's clue, Cathy's *Finesse Position* moved to her slot 2 and her *Second Finesse Position* moved to her slot 3.
  - Normally, *Ejection* calls for the *Second Finesse Position*, but in this case, Cathy knows that *Stacked 5 Color Ejections* call for the *First Finesse Position* instead of the *Second Finesse Position*, so Cathy blind-plays slot 2 (instead of slot 3).

### The Stacked Discharge/Charm

- First, see the section on *[Stacked Ejection](#the-stacked-ejection)*.
- Just like *Stacked Ejection*, it is possible to do a *Stacked Discharge* or a *Stacked Charm* in the exact same way.
