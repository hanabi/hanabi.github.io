### The Trash Push Prompt & The Trash Push Finesse

- If a player performs a *Trash Push* on a *one-away-from-playable* card, it is a signal that someone else has the connecting card as a *Prompt* or a *Finesse*.

<br />

### The Trash Pull

- Normally, when known-trash cards are clued, it is a *Trash Chop Move*.
- Otherwise, when players can see that the clue cannot be a *Trash Chop Move*, they should instead interpret the clue as a *Trash Double Ignition*.
- Rarely, players can see that a clue cannot be a *Trash Chop Move* or a *Trash Double Ignition*. In this situation, it should instead be interpreted as a *Trash Pull*, which is explained below.
- A *Trash Pull* is similar to a *5 Pull* in that it "pulls" the card to the right of the card that was clued. This is a useful tool to have because sometimes, towards the end of the game, there can be a playable card in the middle of someone's hand that is not cluable directly due to the presence of other blocking cards.
- Remember that a *Trash Pull* can only be performed if there is no other explanation for the clue.
- Since players often perform *Burn* clues for stalling purposes in the *End-Game*, care has to be taken to not confuse a normal *Burn* clue with a *Trash Pull*. This is especially true if there was nothing else obvious for the clue giver to do!
- *Trash Pulls* should typically be used as a last-resort since they might be misinterpreted.

<br />

#### Interaction with Trash Double Ignition

- *Trash Pulls* and *Trash Double Ignition* are initiated in nearly the exact same way, so this can be confusing.
- *Trash Pulls* take precedence over *Trash Double Ignition*. This means that if everyone can see that the *Trash Pull* was necessary to "get" a blocking card, then no-one else on the team is promised to have a playable card. (This follows from *[Occam's Razor](../level-10.md#clue-interpretation--occams-razor)*.)
