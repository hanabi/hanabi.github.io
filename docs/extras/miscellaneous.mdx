### No Valid Turn 1 Clues

- Though rare, it is possible to have a turn 1 with no valid clues to gives [No 5s, no unique 2s on chop, no play clues]. When this occurs, we agree it is best to give a clue that causes the 'least' damage with a bomb [or the most 'benefit' with a bomb].
- This decision is highly contextual based on each individual game - but since any clue given will be interpreted as a play clue, it is up to Alice to choose the best option to bomb.
- This only applies to turn 1 where Alice has 8 clues and cannot discard. Once the first clue is given, if the game state immediately goes back to 8 clues [Cathy discards], it is a standard 8 clue stalling situation. Note that in almost every situation, it is Bob that will bomb a card.
- Sample of least 'damage':

  - Alice sees no valid clues to give on turn 1. Alice sees that Bob has a y4 on chop, and Cathy has a y4 in slot 2. Alice chooses to clue Bob yellow touching his slot 5 causing y4 to bomb immediately. Cathy assumes Alice had no legal clues to give on turn 1 and chose a card to bomb. She is not promised the other copy of y4, but agrees that a random 4 is better to bomb than a 3 in Bobs hand.

- Sample of most 'benefit':
  - Alice sees no valid clues to give on turn 1. Alice sees that Bob has a a p4 on finesse position. Alice sees that Cathy's hand is x x r3 b3 y3. Alice clues Cathy 3, touching her 3s. Bob bombs slot 1 (p4) and Cathy assumes Alice had no legal clues to give on turn 1 and chose to make Bob bomb while picking up all of her 3s.

### Double Prompts in Multi-Color Variants

- Normally, when a multi-color card is _Prompted_ from someone's hand, they should play the card that has the most positive information.
- However, what if they are _Prompted_ for two cards of the same multi-color suit? They should play the card with the most positive information first, even if it is not the left-most card.
- For example, in a 3-player rainbow game:
  - Rainbow 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a slot 1 card that has a blue clue on it. (Thus, it is either a blue card or a rainbow card.)
  - Bob also has a slot 3 card that has a blue clue and a red clue on it. (Thus, it is a known rainbow card.)
  - Alice clues Cathy about a rainbow 4.
  - Bob is promised the rainbow 2 and the rainbow 3, so he knows that these cards must be on slots 1 and slot 3.
  - However, Bob also knows that you should always play the card with the most information on it first, so he plays his slot 3 card as rainbow 2 (instead of slot 1, the left-most card).

### The Elimination Rewrite (for 1's)

- Normally, when a playable card is discarded, a player will write _Elimination Notes_ on their hand for the other copy of the card.
- However, there is a special case when **two** copies of the same 1 are discarded. The original _Elimination Notes_ from the discard of the first 1 no longer apply because it is possible that the player has drawn the third copy of the 1 before the second copy could be clued.
- Thus, when a player discards the second copy of a playable 1, they should delete all of their _Elimination Notes_ from the first discard and rewrite all of the _Elimination Notes_ on the rest of their hand anew (essentially acting like the second discard was the first discard).
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice discards a red 1. Alice writes _Elimination Notes_ on her slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.
  - On her next turn, Alice discards an unrelated card. She now has _Elimination Notes_ on slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.
  - On her next turn, Alice discards another red 1. Normally, she would now have _Elimination Notes_ on slot 4 and slot 5. However, because of the _Elimination Rewrite_, she instead writes _Elimination Notes_ on slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.

### The Negative Blind-Play

- Given enough negative clues on a card (and potentially some ancillary information based on the history of the game), it is possible to narrow down the identity of an unclued card in your hand to possibilities that only include playable cards that are not already touched in someone else's hand.
- In this situation, you are expected to blind-play the card.
