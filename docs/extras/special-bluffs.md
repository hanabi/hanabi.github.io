### Self Color Bluffs (1-for-1 Form) (SCB)

- It is possible (and fairly common) to perform a *Self-Bluff* on a player with a rank clue.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Bob, which touches one new 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob does not see any playable cards in anyone else's hand.
  - The closest 4 to being playable is the red 4, so Bob knows that the 4 in his hand is probably a red 4.
  - Since Bob does not see any red 3's, Bob knows he must have the red 3, and he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a blue 1 and successfully plays.
  - Bob now knows that he was *Bluffed* by Alice and that the 4 in his hand is exactly red 4.

<SelfColorBluff />

- Doing a *Self-Bluff* on a player with a color clue is a bit more weird. On the face of it, a *Self Color Bluff* would be nonsensical, since the receiving player would have negative color on the card that they are blind-playing - they would explicitly know that the blind-card cannot possibly "connect".
- Nonetheless, we agree that in this situation, players should blind-play a card anyway as a *Known Bluff*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which "fills in" a card with a number 4 clue on it. It is now a globally-known red 4.
  - This must be a *Play Clue* on the red 4, since Alice is not in a stalling situation. (If Alice was in a stalling situation, then she would be allowed to give a "fill-in" clue without anything special happening.)
  - Bob does not see any red cards in other player's hands, so it cannot be a *Prompt* or a *Reverse Finesse*.
  - Bob cannot possibly have the red 3 in his *Finesse Position*, because that card has negative red.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this must be a *Self Color Bluff*, so he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Bluff* on any playable non-red card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.

<SelfColorBluff2 />

- Note that *Self Color Bluffs* should not be confused with the more-ordinary "fill-in" clues that are used in stalling situations. (See the [Allowable Stall Clues](../level-8.md#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table) section.) In other words, **if someone could be in a stalling situation, you should never blind-play a card from a fill-in clue**.
- *Self Color Bluffs* are not very good and should only be used sparingly, because:
  - they can be confusing
  - they almost always have an efficiency of a 1-for-1
- Expert players can use *Self Color Bluffs* as a nice alternative to giving a 1-for-1 directly to the card in *Finesse Position*. Doing so has the advantage of "filling in" an ancillary card in the hand.
- More examples of a *Self Color Bluff* can be found [here](../examples/self-color-bluff.md).

<br />

### Self Color Bluff (2-for-1 Form) (SCB)

- Rarely, it is also possible to perform a *Self Color Bluff* as a 2-for-1.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which touches a new red card on his slot 2.
  - This must be a *Play Clue* on the red card.
  - Bob has a negative 3 clue on his red card, so he knows it cannot possibly be a red 3 (the next playable red card).
  - Bob does not see any red cards in other player's hands, so it cannot be a *Prompt* or a *Reverse Finesse*.
  - Bob cannot possibly have the red 3 in his *Finesse Position*, because that card now has negative red.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this must be a *Self Color Bluff*, so he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Bluff* on any playable non-red card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Bob marks his red card as a red 4 (since that is the red card that is *one-away-from-playable*).

<SelfColorBluff3 />

### Self Color Double Bluff (SCDB)

- Just like normal bluffs, *Self Color Bluffs* are done by "filling in" a card that is *one-away-from-playable* or a legal *Bluff* target.
- However, players can also perform a *Self Color Double Bluff* by "filling in" a card that is *two-or-more-away-from-playable* and not a legal *Bluff* target.
- For example, in a 3-player game (similar to the previous example):
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which touches a new red card on his slot 2.
  - This must be a *Play Clue* on the red card, since Alice is not in a stalling situation. (If Alice was in a stalling situation, then she would be allowed to give a "fill-in" clue without anything special happening.)
  - Bob has a negative 3 clue on his red card, so he knows it cannot possibly be a red 3 (the next playable red card).
  - Bob does not see any red cards in other player's hands, so it cannot be a *Prompt* or a *Reverse Finesse*.
  - Bob cannot possibly have the red 3 in his *Finesse Position*, because that card now has negative red.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this must be a *Self Color Bluff*, so he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Bluff* on any playable non-red card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Bob marks his red card as a red 4 (since that is the red card that is *one-away-from-playable*).
  - Cathy sees that Alice did a *Self Color Bluff* on Bob. However, Cathy sees that the red card in Bob's hand is the red 5, which is *two-away-from-playable*. That means that Alice means to perform a *Self Color Double Bluff* (instead of a single *Bluff*).
  - Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Bluff*. It is a blue 2 and it successfully plays on the stacks.
  - Bob is surprised by Cathy's blind-play and realizes that it must be related to the clue that Alice gave. If Bob had a red 4 in his hand, then Cathy would not have gone on to blind-play anything. So, Bob erases his note of "red 4" and instead writes "red 5", because that is the only red card that is *two-away-from-playable*, and is the only card that would make Cathy blind-play.

- More examples of a *Self Color Double Bluff* can be found [here](../examples/self-color-double-bluff.md).

### Stacked Bluffs (Exception)

- First, see the section explaining that [*Stacked Bluffs* are illegal](../level-10.md#stacked-bluffs-illegal).
- Rarely, a player can know that a *Layered Finesse* is impossible. This could be because they know the identity of every card in their hand (minus their *Finesse Position* card). Or, alternatively, they could have relevant negative information on their entire hand.
- If the player can rule out a *Layered Finesse*, then it is possible to perform a *Stacked Bluff* on them. It is important to note that such a player is "locked in" to the *Bluff* and should almost always immediately play their *Finesse Position* card.

<br />

### The Elimination Bluff & The Elimination Layered Finesse

- Normally, if a player has *Elimination Notes* on their hand, you can clue the next card in the suit to perform an *Elimination Finesse*.
- It is also possible to pretend like you are performing an *Elimination Finesse* on someone in order to get an unrelated card to blind-play from their oldest slot.
- If the player who performed the clue was in *Bluff Seat*, then it is to be treated like a *Bluff*, and thus they will not know where the actual *Elimination Card* is. (However, in most cases, at this point there will only be one remaining card with an *Elimination Note* on it, so it won't matter.)
- If the player who performed the clue was not in *Bluff Seat*, then the blind-playing player is expected to keep playing until they find the intended card. This is similar to how a *Layered Finesse* works, but it is inverted such that they play cards from oldest to newest.

<br />

### The Known Priority Bluff

- Players generally perform *Priority Bluffs* by tricking players into thinking they have a specific card. However, it is also possible to perform a *Known Priority Bluff*.
- For example:
  - Alice has a three known playable cards: red 1, blue 4, and blue 5.
  - Bob has a known red 2.
  - Alice is expected to play the red 1 into the red 2, so the red 1 has *Priority*.
  - Instead, Alice plays the blue 4.
  - Normally, Bob would think that this is a *Priority Finesse* on the blue 5. However, both he and Alice know that Alice has the blue 5.
  - This must be a *Known Priority Bluff*, so Bob plays his *Finesse Position* card as any playable card.

<KnownPriorityBluff />

- Just like normal *Bluffs*, players are only allowed to perform a *Known Priority Bluff* on the very next player.

<br />

### The Pestilent Triple Bluff

- First, see the section on the *[Pestilent Double Bluff](../level-14.md#the-pestilent-double-bluff-pdb)*.
- Normally, when cluing a non-trash card, two blind-plays is enough to for the clued player to write the correct note on the card.
- Rarely, in a 5-player game, two blind-plays is not enough, and the note is still wrong. In these cases, Alice would be intending for Donald to play as a *Pestilent Triple Bluff*.
- Note that normally, *Triple Bluffs* are explicitly illegal. But *Pestilent Triple Bluffs* are an exception to this rule.
- For example, in a 5-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Emily, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob attempts to blind-play a red 2 from his *Finesse Position*. Instead, it is a blue 2, and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that this is probably a *4's Double Bluff*. Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* as any playable card. It is a blue 3 and it successfully plays.
  - Donald knows that Emily will go on to incorrectly think that her red 4 is a blue 4 (because Alice's clue looks like a *Double Finesse*). Thus, Alice's clue is quite strange.
  - Alice must be intending for Donald to also blind-play his *Finesse Position* in order to "heal" the problem. Donald blind-plays his *Finesse Position*. It is a green 2 and it successfully plays.
  - At first, Emily thought that her 4 was the blue 4 (connecting to the blue 2 and the blue 3). However, if that was the case, then Donald would not have blind-played anything. Emily knows that this must be a *Pestilent Triple Bluff*, and her 4 is any other 4 than blue 4 (because Donald blind-played) and green 4 (because Bob would have waited for Donald).

### The Pass Bluff

- First, see the section on the *[Hesitation Blind-Play](../level-22.md#the-hesitation-blind-play)*.
- It is possible for a *Hesitation Blind-Play* to occur without anyone intending it to happen. However, if a player intentionally tries to make a *Hesitation Blind-Play* occur, it is called a *Pass Bluff*.
- In other words, after a *Finesse* occurs that is directed at you, you will know that your *Finesse Position* card is playable. If the next immediate player also has an unrelated playable card on their *Finesse Position*, you can pretend like the *Finesse* wasn't directed at you. This will cause them to think that the *Finesse* was directed at them, and you will get the unrelated card played for free.
- After the unrelated card is played, the next player should **not** continue to blind-play cards (as a *Layered Finesse*) because:
  - The "passing" player fulfills the real *Finesse* on their next turn.
  - The "passing" player was in *Bluff Seat*.
- *Pass Bluffs* rely on contextual information in order to work, so the circumstances in which you can do them are narrow.
- It is illegal for a player to perform a *Pass Bluff* if they could be *Bluffed*. (This is because the first *Bluff* would not resolve immediately and would violate *Lie Principle*.)
  - Subsequently, it is also illegal for a player to pass an *Ejection* to the next player.

<br />

### The Double/Triple Pass Bluff

- After a player performs a *Pass Bluff*, when it becomes their turn again, if they see an unrelated playable card on the *Second Finesse Position* of the next player, they can perform yet another *Pass Bluff*, implying that the first *Pass Bluff* was not a *Pass Bluff* at all and instead simply a *Layered Finesse* or *Clandestine Finesse*.
- Then, after the unrelated card is played, the player who initiated the *Double Pass Bluff* can go ahead and play into the real *Finesse*.
- Alternatively, if there continue to be playable cards, they can keep *Pass Bluffing*.

<br />

### The Purge Bluff (Layered Bluff)

- This convention only applies to 3-player games.
- Sometimes, a player will have a fully playable hand from left to right. In this situation, players will normally try to perform a *Layered Finesse* in order to get all of the cards in the most efficient manner. However, a *Layered Finesse* may not always be available.
- In extremely rare situations, it is possible to orchestrate a *Lie* in which the player with the fully playable hand thinks that they are *Layered Finessed* when they really do not have the connecting card. After they play their final card and it is not the connecting card, they will know that they were *Purge Bluffed* and that nobody has the missing card.
- Care has to be taken that the other player (e.g. the player who is not *Purge Bluffed*) will understand what is going on. For example, they might think that a *Patch Finesse* is happening. Thus, *Purge Bluffs* can only be done in expert games where there is **no other possible interpretation for what is happening**.
- If the player blind-playing cards into a *Purge Bluff* realizes that a *Lie* has occurred before they finish blind-playing their entire hand, they are supposed to stop. In other words, they are **not** supposed to continue blind-playing cards as a *Known Purge Bluff*.
- Examples of a *Purge Bluff* can be found [here](../examples/purge-bluff.md).
