### The Just-In-Time Fix Clue (JIT)

- When performing a _Layered Finesse_ with a _Lie Component_, if the plan is to give a _Fix Clue_ to the _Finesse Target_ card (the "final" card that is to be blind-played), then it is important to wait until the **last** moment to give the _Fix Clue_. This is because after receiving the _Fix Clue_, the player will not play any more blind cards.
- Thus, you should first wait for all of the "good" blind cards to play, and **then** give the _Fix Clue_ to the _Finesse Target_, so that it comes "just in time" before the misplay.
- Alternatively, if the plan is to give a _Fix Clue_ to some **other** card than the _Finesse Target_ (e.g. a number 5 clue to a 5 in the middle of the hand), then the _Fix Clue_ does not necessarily have to be just in time. It can be done early, and the player will know that they have to continue blind-playing cards until they find the _Finesse Target_.

### The Speed-up Clue

- The _Layered Finesse_ convention (and its derivatives) are very efficient (in terms of "X-for-1"). However, sometimes it can be very slow (low-_Tempo_), as players will have to allow for all possible _Reverse Finesses_ before playing anything. This is generally not a problem in 3-player games, but _Tempo_ is important in 5-player games.
- Normally, when the _Finesse Target_ (the card that is to be blind-played) is clued directly, it is a mistake due to someone not paying close enough attention. We refer to this as _Stomping on a Finesse_.
- However, if high-_Tempo_ is needed, a player can consider intentionally _stomping_ on a _Layered Finesse_ in order to "speed up" the play of a specific card that leads into other players hands.
- One complicating factor of the _Speed-up Clue_ is how to differentiate it from a more-ordinary _Fix Clue_. In other words, after the clued card is played, on their next turn, should the player go back and blind-play the other cards? If it was a _Speed-up Clue_, they should. If it was a _Fix Clue_, they should not.
- The key lies in the context of the clue:
  - Was it possible to take an equivalent line where a _Fix Clue_ would not be needed? (In terms of the same number of clues, and no risk of discarding critical/playable cards.) If yes, then it is a _Speed-up Clue_.
  - Is the timing of the _Fix Clue_ appropriate? If not, then it might be a _Speed Up_ clue.
