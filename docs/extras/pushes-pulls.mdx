### The Trash Push Prompt & The Trash Push Finesse

- If a player performs a _Trash Push_ on a _one-away-from-playable_ card, it is a signal that someone else has the connecting card as a _Prompt_ or a _Finesse_.

### The Trash Pull

- Normally, when known-trash cards are clued, it is a _Trash Chop Move_.
- Otherwise, when players can see that the clue cannot be a _Trash Chop Move_, they should instead interpret the clue as a _Trash Double Ignition_.
- Rarely, players can see that a clue cannot be a _Trash Chop Move_ or a _Trash Double Ignition_. In this situation, it should instead be interpreted as a _Trash Pull_, which is explained below.
- A _Trash Pull_ is similar to a _5 Pull_ in that it "pulls" the card to the right of the card that was clued. This is a useful tool to have because sometimes, towards the end of the game, there can be a playable card in the middle of someone's hand that is not cluable directly due to the presence of other blocking cards.
- Remember that a _Trash Pull_ can only be performed if there is no other explanation for the clue.
- Similarly to a _5 Pull_, if multiple cards are touched, the pulled card is next to the left-most one of them,
- In the _End-Game_, it is common for players to perform _Burn_ clues for stalling purposes. Players have to be extra careful not confuse a _Burn_ clue with a _Trash Pull_. This is especially true if there was nothing else obvious for the clue giver to do!
- _Trash Pulls_ should typically be used as a last-resort since they might be misinterpreted.

#### Interaction with Trash Double Ignition

- _Trash Pulls_ and _Trash Double Ignition_ are initiated in nearly the exact same way, so this can be confusing.
- _Trash Pulls_ take precedence over _Trash Double Ignition_. This means that if everyone can see that the _Trash Pull_ was necessary to "get" a blocking card, then no-one else on the team is promised to have a playable card. (This follows from _[Occam's Razor](../level-11.mdx#clue-interpretation--occams-razor)_.)
