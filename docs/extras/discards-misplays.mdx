### The Cautious Generation Discard

- First, see the section on the _[Generation Discard](../level-7.mdx#the-generation-discard)_.
- Often times, a player will have a clued card in their hand, but not know the exact identity of it yet. In these situations, the player might think that the team needs a playable card in someone else's hand, when the team really has it already.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks. No blue cards are played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a blue 1 in her hand. She knows the exact identity of it, so it is known playable.
  - Alice also has a 4 clued in her hand. She does not know what color it is.
  - There are 0 clues, so if Alice plays the blue 1, Bob will be forced to discard.
  - Alice sees that Cathy has a red 4 on chop, which is playable. If Alice does not have red 4 in her hand, then Cathy could potentially discard the red 4 (after Bob is forced to discard).
- Here, if Alice does not have a red 4, then doing a _Generation Discard_ for Cathy's red 4 would be required. On the other hand, if Alice does have a red 4, then doing a _Generation Discard_ for Cathy's red 4 would be redundant.
- In order to cover both cases, Alice _must_ take the more conservative approach and always perform a _Generation Discard_. These kinds of _Generation Discards_ are called _Cautious Generation Discards_ to differentiate them from the more ordinary kind.
- After a _Cautious Generation Discard_ happens, the next player is put into a tricky situation: was it really a _Generation Discard_ (for Cathy)? Or could it be a _Scream Discard_ (for Bob)? In order to cover both cases, the next player should not _Chop Move_, but they should also not discard on their turn.
- For example, continuing the scenario from before:
  - Alice does not know whether or not the team needs Cathy's red 4, so Alice is forced to perform a _Cautious Generation Discard_.
  - Bob sees that Alice does indeed already have the red 4 clued in her hand. So, from his perspective, if Alice was performing a _Generation Discard_, it would be a _Cautious Generation Discard_.
  - However, it is also possible that Alice's move could be a _Scream Discard_ for Bob.
  - Bob knows that in this situation, he needs to cover both cases.
  - Thus, Bob does not perform a _Chop Move_. Additionally, he does not need to clue the red 4 on Cathy's chop (because Alice already has it), but he **will** spend a clue in some other productive fashion. If Bob has nothing productive to do, he must "burn" a clue, similar to what happens when a _Scream Discard_ occurs.

### The Triple Positional Discard

- At the end of the game, it is normal for players to use a _Positional Discard_ to get 1 card to blind-play, and to use a _Positional Misplay_ to get 2 cards to blind-play.
- If a player does a _Positional Discard_ to only get 1 card when they could have performed a _Positional Misplay_ instead, then this is quite strange. If they are not making a mistake, they must be trying to send an additional message.
- In this situation, they intend for it to promise 3 blind-plays instead of 1.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - The team has 0 strikes.
  - It is the _End-Game_ and Alice sees all of the remaining useful cards. Thus, she can _Positionally Discard_ or _Positionally Misplay_ any card that she wants in her hand.
  - Alice sees that Bob, Cathy, and Donald all have playable cards on slot 2.
  - Alice blind-discards her slot 2 card as a _Triple Positional Discard_.
  - From Bob's perspective, he sees that Cathy and Donald have a playable card on slot 2. Thus, Bob expected Alice to perform a _Positional Misplay_ on her slot 2 card.
  - When Bob sees that Alice performed a _Positional Discard_ instead of a _Positional Misplay_, he knows that she must be intending for 3 blind-plays to happen (instead of 1) as a _Triple Positional Discard_.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 2 card (to match Alice's slot 2 discard). It successfully plays.
  - Cathy and Donald are both in a similar situation to Bob. (They expected Alice to perform a _Positional Misplay_.)
  - Thus, they both know that this is a _Triple Positional Discard_, and blind-play their slot 2 cards (to match Alice's slot 2 discard).

<TriplePositionalDiscard />

- In some specific situations, a _Positional Discard_ from chop would not work, because it would just look like a normal discard. In these situations, a _Positional Misplay_ would only get 1 blind-play (instead of 2) and a _Shallow Discard_ would only get 2 blind-plays (instead of 3).

### The Quadruple Positional Misplay

- First, see the section on the _[Triple Positional Discard](#the-triple-positional-discard)_.
- In a 5-player game, it possible to perform a _Quadruple Positional Misplay_, causing 4 people to blind-play from the same slot. (This works for the same reasons that a _Triple Positional Discard_ works.)
- For example, in a 5-player game:
  - The team has 0 strikes.
  - It is the _End-Game_ and Alice sees all of the remaining useful cards. Thus, she can _Positionally Discard_ or _Positionally Misplay_ any card that she wants in her hand.
  - Alice sees that Bob, Cathy, Donald, and Emily all have playable cards on slot 2.
  - Alice blind-plays her slot 2 card as a _Quadruple Positional Misplay_.
  - From Bob's perspective, he sees that Cathy, Donald, and Emily have a playable card on slot 2. Thus, Bob expected Alice to perform a _Triple Positional Discard_ on her slot 2 card.
  - When Bob sees that Alice performed a _Positional Misplay_ instead of a _Triple Positional Discard_, he knows that she must be intending for 4 blind-plays to happen (instead of 2) as a _Quadruple Positional Misplay_.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 2 card (to match Alice's slot 2 discard). It successfully plays.
  - Cathy, Donald, and Emily are all in a similar situation to Bob. (They expected Alice to perform a _Triple Positional Discard_.)
  - Thus, they all know that this is a _Quadruple Positional Misplay_, and blind-play their slot 2 cards (to match Alice's slot 2 discard).

### The Promise Clue & The Promise Discard

- First, see the section on the _[Certain Finesse](../level-10.mdx#the-certain-finesse--the-certain-discard)_.
- When a _Certain Finesse_ happens, players can blind-discard their _Finesse Position_ card, because a _Layered Finesse_ is impossible. However, when a normal _Finesse_ happens, players cannot blind-discard anything, just in case a _Layered Finesse_ is happening.
- Sometimes, after a _Finesse_ has occurred, but before the promised card has been blind-played, a teammate might find strategic value in duplicating the promised card.
- If a teammate duplicates the promised card, and the duplication was not a last-resort, then it **promises** that the duplicated card is exactly on _Finesse Position_. This is called a _Promise Clue_.
- The _Promise Clue_ allows the recipient of the _Finesse_ to blind-discard the card as a _Promise Discard_. (A _Promise Discard_ is almost exactly like a _Certain Discard_.)
- Finally, from the perspective of the player receiving the clue, if they play the duplicated card first, then they should know that the focus of the original clue was on the other, non-duplicated card, and they can go on to play it afterwards. (Otherwise, the original clue would be fairly low-value.)
- For example, in a 5-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 2 as a _Play Clue_. This is a _Finesse_ on Cathy's red 1.
  - Bob sees that Alice has four 1's in her hand. This would be a juicy 4-for-1 clue.
  - Bob clues number 1 to Alice, touching four 1's: red 1, yellow 1, green 1, and blue 1.
  - Cathy knows that Alice performed a _Finesse_ on her for the red 1. If she happens to play the red 1, then Alice will go on to misplay the red 1 as a purple 1.
  - Cathy also knows that it is possible that Alice performed a _Layered Finesse_ on her. For example, Cathy could have purple 1 in her _Finesse Position_ and red 1 in her _Second Finesse Position_. If this were the case, and Cathy blind-discarded the purple 1, then the team could lose the only visible copy of purple 1, which would be really bad.
  - However, because of the _Promise Clue_ convention, Cathy knows that Bob has promised that the red 1 happens to be exactly on her _Finesse Position_ and that no _Layered Finesse_ is happening.
  - Cathy blind-discards her _Finesse Position_ card as a _Promise Discard_.

<PromiseClue />

- Note that as long as the duplication clue touches two or more cards (e.g. with an efficiency of a 1-for-1), the _Promise Discard_ interpretation takes priority over the _Unknown Trash Discharge_ interpretation.
