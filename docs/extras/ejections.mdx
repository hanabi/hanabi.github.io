- An *Ejection* refers to a _Signal Shift_ blind-play in which someone plays an unrelated card from their *Second Finesse Position*.
  - For example, if a player's hand is completely unclued, their *Second Finesse Position* is slot 2.
- Just like a *Bluff*, an *Ejection* can only be performed on the very next player.

### The 5 Color Ejection

- The _5 Color Ejection_ is covered at [level 15](../level-15.mdx#the-5-color-ejection-5ce).
- This results in a _Signal Shift_ from _Play_ --> _Save_.

<br />

### Trash Push Ejection

- First, see the section on the [Trash Push](../level-13.mdx#the-trash-push).
- Normally, when known-trash is touched as the focus of the clue, and the known-trash is on chop, it communicates a _Trash Push_.
- However, what if the _Trash Pushed_ card is two-or-more-away-from-playable? This would normally be a _Trash Push Double Finesse_ on Bob, but that is unlikely.
- Instead, since no single play could ever prevent the _Pushed_ card from immediately misplaying, Bob interprets the clue as an _Ejection_.
- After a _Trash Push Ejection_, the clue receiver should _Chop Move_ the two-or-more-away-from-playable card.

<br />

### The Bad Chop Move Ejection

- Many moves result in one or more cards becoming _Chop Moved_. However, what if such a move is used when the _Chop Moved_ card(s) are all trash? The other players can see that this move must have been done for some other reason.
- In this situation, it should signal an _Ejection_ on the very next player.
- This results in a _Signal Shift_ from _Save_ --> _Trash_.
- **Any** move that results in a _Chop Move_ can be used to initiate such an _Ejection_.
- Duplicated cards can be chop moved for distribution purposes and should not be considered as _Chop Moving_ trash.
- _Bad Chop Move Ejections_ can be performed throughout the game. (But keep in mind that in the _End-Game_, a player might just be stalling.)

<br />

### The Rank Choice Ejection (with a number 2 or a number 5) (RCE)

- Typically, when a number 2 clue or a number 5 clue is performed on a chop card, it will be treated as a _2 Save_ or a _5 Save_ and the card will not play.
- If a player performs a _2 Save_ or a _5 Save_ on a playable card and they could have easily used a normal color _Play Clue_, this is quite strange. They must be trying to communicate something extra.
- In this situation, they intend for an _Ejection_ on the very next player.
- This results in a _Signal Shift_ from _Save_ --> _Play_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is completely unclued and is, from newest to oldest: blue 3, blue 3, blue 4, blue 4, red 2
  - Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching the red 2 as a _2 Save_.
  - Bob sees that the obvious clue to give to Cathy was red, as it would actually get the red 2 played right now.
  - This move is so bad that it must be communicating something extra. Alice must be intending for a _Rank Choice Ejection_. Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_ card and it is a blue 1 and successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that since a number 2 clue cause Bob to blind-play his _Second Finesse Position_, this must be an _Ejection_. The only type of _Ejection_ that matches this kind of clue is a _Rank Choice Ejection_, so Cathy knows that her 2 must be playable and that her 2 must be exactly the red 2. Cathy plays the red 2.

### The Trash Ejection

- First, see the section on the _[Trash Double Ignition](../level-21.mdx#the-trash-double-ignition)_.
- In certain situations, if a player clues a previously untouched card that is globally known as trash, it triggers a _Trash Double Ignition_.
- However, what if the next player can see that a _Trash Double Ignition_ is impossible? In this situation, if the clue-giver is not making a mistake, they instead intend for an _Ejection_ on the very next player.

<br />

### The Replay Ejection

- First, see the section on the _[Replay Double Ignition](../level-21.mdx#the-replay-double-ignition)_.
- Normally, if a player re-clues a card that is globally known as playable, it triggers a _Replay Double Ignition_.
- However, what if the next player can see that a _Replay Double Ignition_ is impossible? In this situation, if the clue-giver is not making a mistake, they instead intend for an _Ejection_ on the very next player.
- In most circumstances, _Replay Ejections_ can not be performed by re-cluing a card in Bob's hand. This is because Bob would interpret it as a _Fix Clue_, meaning that the card that Bob was about to play is actually bad and that he should discard it instead of playing it.
- Note that the _Replay Ejection_ is "turned off" in the _End-Game_. (This is because players often clue playable cards as a _Burn Clue_.)

<br />

### The Poke Ejection

- First, see the section on the _[Poke Double Ignition](../level-21.mdx#the-poke-double-ignition)_.
- Normally, if a player re-clues globally known-trash, it triggers a _Poke Double Ignition_.
- However, what if the next player can see that a _Poke Double Ignition_ is impossible? In this situation, if the clue-giver is not making a mistake, they instead intend for an _Ejection_ on the very next player.
