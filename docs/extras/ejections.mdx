- An *Ejection* refers to a _Signal Shift_ blind-play in which someone plays an unrelated card from their *Second Finesse Position*.
  - For example, if a player's hand is completely unclued, their *Second Finesse Position* is slot 2.
- Just like a *Bluff*, an *Ejection* can only be performed on the very next player.

### The 5 Color Ejection

- The _5 Color Ejection_ is covered at [level 16](../level-16.mdx#the-5-color-ejection-5ce).
- This results in a _Signal Shift_ from _Play_ --> _Save_.

### Trash Push Ejection

- First, see the section on the [Trash Push](../level-14.mdx#the-trash-push).
- Normally, when known-trash is touched as the focus of the clue, and the known-trash is on chop, it communicates a _Trash Push_.
- However, what if the _Trash Pushed_ card is two-or-more-away-from-playable? This would normally be a _Trash Push Double Finesse_ on Bob, but that is unlikely.
- Instead, since no single play could ever prevent the _Pushed_ card from immediately misplaying, Bob interprets the clue as an _Ejection_.
- After a _Trash Push Ejection_, the clue receiver should _Chop Move_ the two-or-more-away-from-playable card.

### The Bad Chop Move Ejection (BCME)

- Many moves result in one or more cards becoming _Chop Moved_. However, what if such a move is used when the _Chop Moved_ card(s) are all trash? The other players can see that this move must have been done for some other reason.
- In this situation, it should signal an _Ejection_ on the very next player.
- This results in a _Signal Shift_ from _Save_ --> _Trash_.
- **Any** move that results in a _Chop Move_ can be used to initiate such an _Ejection_.
- Duplicated cards can be chop moved for distribution purposes and should not be considered as _Chop Moving_ trash.
- _Bad Chop Move Ejections_ can be performed throughout the game. (But keep in mind that in the _End-Game_, a player might just be stalling.)
- Note that sometimes, players perform _Chop Moves_ on the other copy of currently clued cards. This can be useful for distribution purposes, meaning that everyone will have a card to play on the final round of the game. For this reason, a _Bad Chop Move Ejection_ can only be triggered when chop moving cards that have been played already.

### The Bad Trash Finesse Ejection / The Bad Trash Bluff Ejection

- Since we assume that [_Trash Finesses_ and _Trash Bluffs_ are always unnecessary](../level-25.mdx#trash-finesses-and-trash-bluffs-are-always-unnecessary), it would be strange if a _Trash Finesse_ resulted in a _Chop Move_ of all trash.
- We agree that in this situation, the reacting player should not play their _First Finesse Position_ (like they would in a normal _Trash Finesse_). Instead, they should _Eject_, as a special form of _Bad Chop Move Ejection_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 and yellow 1 are on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is completely unclued and is, from newest to oldest: green 2, red 3, yellow 5, yellow 1, red 2.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, which will be seen as a _Play Clue_ on one of the unplayed 1's.
  - Bob knows that regardless of his hand layout, blind-playing from his _First Finesse Position_ would result in Cathy _Chop Moving_ the red 2, which is trash.
  - Since that would be a bad _Chop Move_, Bob knows Alice must instead be intending for a _Bad Trash Finesse Ejection_. Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_ card. It is a blue 1 and successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that her clued 1 must be trash, and that the card behind it is also now globally known trash.

### The Trash Finesse Push Ejection / The Trash Bluff Push Ejection

- First, see the sections on the _[Trash Push Ejection](#trash-push-ejection)_ and on the _[Bad Trash Finesse Ejection](#the-bad-trash-finesse-ejection--the-bad-trash-bluff-ejection)_.
- If a player performs a _Trash Finesse_ by touching a chop card, this will always result in a _Trash Push_ (since _[Trash Finesses and Trash Bluffs are always unnecessary](../level-25.mdx#trash-finesses-and-trash-bluffs-are-always-unnecessary)_.
- What if a _Trash Finesse_ is given, but the responding player sees that the resulting pushed card could never be playable by the time it gets to their turn? In other words, what if the pushed card is two-or-more-away-from-playable?
- In this situation, we agree that the reacting player needs to _Eject_ (instead of playing _First Finesse Position_ like they would in a normal _Trash Finesse_).
- After a _Trash Finesse Push Ejection_, the clued player should _Chop Move_ the pushed card for that. (This is similar to how [5 Pull Ejection](../level-19.mdx#the-5-number-ejection-5ne) works.)

### The Rank Choice Ejection (with a number 2 or a number 5) (RCE)

- Typically, when a number 2 clue or a number 5 clue is performed on a chop card, it will be treated as a _2 Save_ or a _5 Save_ and the card will not play.
- If a player performs a _2 Save_ or a _5 Save_ on a playable card and they could have easily used a normal color _Play Clue_, this is quite strange. They must be trying to communicate something extra.
- In this situation, they intend for an _Ejection_ on the very next player.
- This results in a _Signal Shift_ from _Save_ --> _Play_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is completely unclued and is, from newest to oldest: blue 3, blue 3, blue 4, blue 4, red 2
  - Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching the red 2 as a _2 Save_.
  - Bob sees that the obvious clue to give to Cathy was red, as it would actually get the red 2 played right now.
  - This move is so bad that it must be communicating something extra. Alice must be intending for a _Rank Choice Ejection_. Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_ card and it is a blue 1 and successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that since a number 2 clue cause Bob to blind-play his _Second Finesse Position_, this must be an _Ejection_. The only type of _Ejection_ that matches this kind of clue is a _Rank Choice Ejection_, so Cathy knows that her 2 must be playable and that her 2 must be exactly the red 2. Cathy plays the red 2.

### The Trash Ejection

- First, see the section on the _[Trash Double Ignition](../level-22.mdx#the-trash-double-ignition-tdi)_.
- In certain situations, if a player clues a previously untouched card that is globally known as trash, it triggers a _Trash Double Ignition_.
- However, what if the next player can see that a _Trash Double Ignition_ is impossible? In this situation, if the clue-giver is not making a mistake, they instead intend for an _Ejection_ on the very next player.

### The Replay Ejection

- First, see the section on the _[Replay Double Ignition](../level-22.mdx#the-replay-double-ignition-rdi)_.
- Normally, if a player re-clues a card that is globally known as playable, it triggers a _Replay Double Ignition_.
- However, what if the next player can see that a _Replay Double Ignition_ is impossible? In this situation, if the clue-giver is not making a mistake, they instead intend for an _Ejection_ on the very next player.
- In most circumstances, _Replay Ejections_ can not be performed by re-cluing a card in Bob's hand. This is because Bob would interpret it as a _Fix Clue_, meaning that the card that Bob was about to play is actually bad and that he should discard it instead of playing it.
- Note that the _Replay Ejection_ is "turned off" in the _End-Game_. (This is because players often clue playable cards as a _Burn Clue_.)

### The Poke Ejection

- First, see the section on the _[Poke Double Ignition](../level-22.mdx#the-poke-double-ignition-pdi)_.
- Normally, if a player re-clues globally known-trash, it triggers a _Poke Double Ignition_.
- However, what if the next player can see that a _Poke Double Ignition_ is impossible? In this situation, if the clue-giver is not making a mistake, they instead intend for an _Ejection_ on the very next player.
