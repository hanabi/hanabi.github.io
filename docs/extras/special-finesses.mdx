### The Ambiguous Finesse Pass-Back (AFPB)

- First, see the section on the [_Ambiguous Finesse_](../level-5.mdx#the-ambiguous-finesse).
- When an _Ambiguous Finesse_ occurs, the first player will not play into the _Finesse_, and do something unrelated. At that point, it is usually clear that **another player** on the team **also** has the connecting card. Normally, that other player should then **immediately blind-play**, resolving the _Ambiguous Finesse_ as fast as possible.
- However, in some specific situations, the second person **cannot** blind-play the card, or else a misplay would occur. In these situations, the second person has to **also** not play into the _Finesse_. This "passes" the blind-play back to the first person again.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Blue 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues blue to Donald, touching a blue 4 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob sees that Cathy has the blue 2 on her _Finesse Position_. From his position, this must be a _Double Finesse_, with Cathy blind-playing the blue 2, and Bob blind-playing the blue 3 from his own _Finesse Position_. Bob discards.
  - Cathy sees that Bob has the blue 2 on his _Finesse Position_ and the blue 3 on his _Second Finesse Position_.
  - Cathy also knows that the only reason that Bob would discard is if Cathy **also** had the blue 2 on her _Finesse Position_. Thus, Bob expects her to blind-play on this turn, and this is an _Ambiguous Finesse_.
  - Normally, Cathy would blind-play the blue 2 herself. However, in this situation, if she blind-plays the blue 2, then Bob would go on to misplay the other blue 2, thinking that it is blue 3.
  - Thus, Cathy must pretend like the _Finesse_ is not on her after all, and force Bob to be the one to blind-play first. Cathy discards her chop card, passing the _Finesse_ back to Bob.
  - Donald and Alice discard.
  - Bob knows that Cathy was supposed to blind-play the blue 2, but she didn't. He must also have the blue 2. Furthermore, he must also have the blue 3, as that would be an excellent reason for Cathy to pass the _Finesse_ back to him. Bob will now blind-play blue 2 and blue 3.

<AmbiguousFinessePassBack />

- As a side note, you may be wondering why in the previous example Cathy does not blind-discard her blue 2 from her _Finesse Position_ instead of discarding her chop. This is because it is possible that Cathy does **not** have the blue 2 on her _Finesse Position_ and instead has some other unrelated playable card as a _Layered Finesse_. Thus, Cathy must play it safe and discard her chop.

### Potential Priority Duplication & The Certain Priority Finesse (or Priority Certain Finesse)

- Normally, players can perform any particular type of _Finesse_ either by giving a clue or by playing a card without _Priority_. For example, it is possible to both do a _Layered Finesse_ (by giving a clue) and a _Layered Priority Finesse_ (by playing a card).
- One exception to this rule is the _Certain Finesse_. When a player perform a _Certain Finesse_, it calls for a _Certain Discard_. However, when a player uses _Priority_ to promise a card that could potentially be in their own hand, this should **not** induce a _Certain Discard_. The other players in this situation should just ignore the _Priority_ and instead discard their chop card. (Doing it this way is much safer because it allow potential _Layered Finesses_ as well as some slack for mistakes.)

### The Certain Finesse Clandestine Exception

- First, see the section on the _[Certain Finesse](../level-10.mdx#the-certain-finesse--the-certain-discard)_.
- This section outlines a specific and rare edge-case for _Certain Finesses_.
- We agree that _Bluffs_ take precedence over _Certain Finesses_. This means that a _Certain Finesse_ cannot normally be performed from _Bluff Seat_.
- _Certain Finesses_ **can** be performed from _Bluff Seat_ if it is strictly impossible to be a _Bluff_. In other words, this means that it is illegal for a player to perform a _Clandestine Finesse_ on the very next player that targets a potentially duplicated card **and** the other player can rule out the possibility of a _Bluff_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 2's & blue 3 is played on the stacks. Green 3 is in the discard pile.
  - Alice has an unknown 3 in her hand that happens to be the red 3.
  - Alice clues number 4 to Cathy, touching a red 4 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows that Alice could be trying to perform a _Finesse_ on a red 3. Normally, he would blind-discard his _Finesse Position_ card as a _Certain Discard_ in order to pass this card back to Alice.
  - However, Bob also knows that this might be a _Bluff_. But wait - his _Finesse Position_ card has negative blue on it. So anything that he blind-plays here would have to be a 3. Thus, this cannot be a _Bluff_, since a 3 would connect to 4 and look like a _Finesse_.
  - The only other possibility that Bob has to worry about is a _Clandestine Finesse_. For example, he could be blind-playing a green 3 **and then** a red 3 after that. If he blind-discarded, that could "kill" the green stack, since the other copy of green 3 is already discarded.
  - However, Bob **also** knows that you are not allowed to perform a _Clandestine Finesse_ from _Bluff Seat_ that could duplicate a card in your hand. Thus, he can discount both the possibility of a _Bluff_ **and** the possibility of a _Clandestine Finesse_.
  - Bob performs a _Certain Discard_ on his _Finesse Position_ card and it is the red 3, successfully passing it back to Alice.

<CertainFinesseException />

- If someone performs a _Certain Discard_ and you have two or more clued cards that could be the target, then you are not promised the order, only that you have the card clued somewhere in your hand. (This part works in the exact same way as a more-ordinary _Sarcastic Discard_.)

### The Patch Finesse

- Sometimes, a player will initiate a _Layered Finesse_ on a card that is behind a _one-away-from-playable_ card. Normally, this would be quite bad, as the player would blind-play the _one-away-from-playable_ card, and it would misplay.
- However, since the _Finesse_ target is considered unplayable from the rest of the team, they can be tricked into blind-playing the exact card that makes the one-away card actually playable. This "patches" the _Layered Finesse_ problem, and now the layer can be fully unwrapped without issues.
- For example, in a 5-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Emily, which is a _Play Clue_ on a red 4.
  - Donald has a blue 3 on his _Finesse Position_, followed by a red 2 and a red 3.
  - Bob discards. (We will return to Bob at the end.)
  - Cathy sees that she must have the red 2 and red 3 on her _Finesse Position_, because even though Donald has the red 2 and the red 3, they are behind an unplayable card (blue 3).
  - Cathy tries to blind-play red 2 and it is instead a blue 2.
  - Donald knew that Alice's clue was _Finessing_ him, since no-one else on the team has any red cards. So, he gasps in surprise when Cathy blind-plays for seemingly no reason.
  - However, Donald knows that he should trust Alice and he should trust Cathy, so he continues to assume that he has the red 2.
  - Donald tries to blind-play red 2 and it is instead the blue 3. Donald now knows that this is a _Patch Finesse_.
  - Emily sees the playable red 2 and red 3 in Donald's hand, so she also knows that this was a _Patch Finesse_. The red card in her hand is either red 3 or red 4.
  - We skipped over Bob - why did he discard? Normally, Bob should think the same thing as Cathy - that he has both the red 2 and the red 3. However, Bob can look ahead and see that a _Patch Finesse_ could occur, so since everything will work perfectly if he does nothing, then he should do nothing. It is also possible that Bob happens to have the red 2 and the red 3, so he should try to blind-play those on the next round if no-one else attempts to blind-play anything.

<PatchFinesse />

### The Known Patch Finesse (Illegal)

- Legal _Patch Finesses_ are **always hidden**, meaning that from the person who is blind-playing a card to "patch" will **never** know that it is a _Patch Finesse_ until **after** they blind-play.
- In other words, if Alice performs a legal _Patch Finesse_, then **no-one else on the team has to even know that the _Patch Finesse_ convention exists** - everything will just work out properly because everyone will just blind-play cards like any other ordinary _Layered Finesse_.
  - The exception is when it comes time for the patched player to begin blind-playing. In this situation, the patched player might be "spooked" from the blind-play of the patcher, because they will not understand why the blind-play happened. In this situation, players need to have full trust and not be spooked when another person on the team successfully blind-plays a card in an unexpected way.

### The Double Patch Finesse (Illegal)

- Building on the _Patch Finesse_, it is theoretically possible for a _Patch Finesse_ to require **two** separate players to patch at the same time.
- However, we expressly forbid this because it is too confusing. Players should **never** consider the possibility of a _Patch Finesse_ with two _Patch Components_.

### The Patch Gentleman's Discard (Illegal)

- Theoretically, it could be possible to perform a _Gentleman's Discard_ that contains a _Patch Component_.
- However, we explicitly disallow this. _Gentleman's Discards_ **must** be for cards that are on slot 1. Otherwise, it would communicate a _Blaze Discard_.

### The Surreptitious Finesse

- _Clandestine Finesses_ are when a color or rank clue "connects" to the card from a blind-play, but the clue receiver must wait for **additional** connecting playable cards to blind-play. Another way of saying this is that _Clandestine Finesses_ have a _Misplay Component_; if the blind-player does not continue to blind-play cards, then the clue receiver will go on to misplay the clued card.
- A similar situation can also happen when a rank clue "connects" the card from a blind-play, but the clue receiver sees **non-connecting** rank cards in the blind-player's hand that are currently playable.
- If the clue receiver waits for these non-connecting cards to blind-play, and they **do** blind-play, then it means that the original clue was on a different suit than it first appeared. This is called a _Surreptitious Self-Finesse_ in order to disambiguate it from a more ordinary _Clandestine Finesse_.
- _Surreptitious Finesses_ have a _Misplay Component_ in almost the exact same way that _Clandestine Finesses_ do, but they just involve non-connecting rank cards.
- Generally speaking, this means that when a **rank** clue initiates a _Finesse_, the clue receiver must always allow for the possibility that subsequent non-connecting rank cards in the blind-player's hand (that are of a **lower** rank than the clue) can possibly be caught up in the _Finesse_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, which touches one 3.
  - Bob blind-plays red 2.
  - Cathy knows that red 2 "connects" to number 3, so she knows that she probably has red 3.
  - However, Cathy also sees that before Bob blind-played the red 2, he had a blue 1 in the slot right after it.
  - Thus, it is possible for Cathy's 3 to actually be blue 3. If it is, Bob will blind-play the blue 1 and Cathy will know that she has blue 2 on her _Finesse Position_.
  - So, Cathy discards (instead of potentially playing the red 3 on this turn) to allow for the possibility of a _Surreptitious Finesse_.

<SurreptitiousFinesse />

- Examples of a _Surreptitious Finesse_ can be found [here](../examples/surreptitious-finesse.mdx).

### Inverted Priority Finesse

- _Priority Finesses_ are considered "free", since they do not cost a clue to perform. Thus, it is extremely rare that a player would decline to perform one if it was possible to do so.
- If a player declines to perform a _Priority Finesse_, and there is nothing else special going on, then they must be trying to communicate something extra.
- They are instead calling for a _Priority Finesse_ on the card that had _Priority_. This is called an _Inverted Priority Finesse_ because it gets a blind-play from playing a card with _Priority_ (as opposed to getting a blind-play from playing a card without _Priority_).
- After a _Inverted Priority Finesse_ occurs, the presence of a normal _Priority Finesse_ is now known to everyone on the team. Thus, the normal _Priority Finesse_ is preserved and should be played into on the next go-around of the table.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice has a choice between playing a red 1 and a blue 2. Both cards are fully known, and no-one else has any clued cards, so the red 1 has _Priority_.
  - Alice plays the red 1.
  - Bob sees that if Alice had played the blue 2, she could have performed a _Priority Finesse_ on Cathy's slot 1 card, the blue 3.
  - Bob knows that there was no reason for Alice to decline the _Priority Finesse_, so this must be an _Inverted Priority Finesse_. Bob blind-plays his slot 1 card, and it is the red 2.
  - Cathy knows that the red 1 had _Priority_, so playing it should not have caused Bob to blind-play anything. Thus, Cathy knows that this must be an _Inverted Priority Finesse_, and she knows that she has a blue 3 on her slot 1. Cathy discards.
  - Alice plays blue 2.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays blue 3.

<InvertedPriorityFinesse />

- Note that _Inverted Priority Finesse_ **will only work if the players are in a certain order**. Otherwise, the player holding the declined priority card can _Play Clue_ the other card, which would destroy the information channel. This means that in most of cases, players should just go with the safer and less complicated option - the normal _Priority Finesse_.

### Finesses with a Lie Component

- _[Lie Principle](../level-11.mdx#lie-principle)_ states all that _Fibs_ must resolve immediately. An untruth that does not resolve immediately is a _Lie_.
- Normally, _Lies_ are expressly illegal. However, some players will occasionally break the rules for the purposes of getting a _Finesse_. We call such moves _Finesses with a Lie Component_.
- Typically, when players _Lie_ out of _Bluff Seat_, the game quickly falls apart; subsequent clues will have different meanings to different players and everyone will become "desynchronized". This typically leads to a loss.
- With that said, it is sometimes possible to construct **safe** lines that contain a _Lie Component_. There is usually deep levels of nuance involved in these lines, so this kind of thing is only recommended for advanced and expert players.
- The previously mentioned _Out-of-Order Finesse_ is a specific example of a _Finesse_ with a _Lie Component_. One key attribute of the _Out-of-Order Finesse_ is that the player who receives the _Fix Clue_ knows that **all** of the related cards are playable, or it would not have been worth the risk (and the confusion) to perform a line with a _Lie Component_ in the first place.
- This concept can be generalized to all _Finesses_ that have a _Lie Component_. After a player receives a _Fix Clue_ in such a situation, they should assume that the _Finesse_ is "still on". So, depending on the situation, they should either know that the initial card that was clued is playable (like in an _Out-of-Order Finesse_) or continue to blind-play cards to fulfill the initial _Finesse_ (if the card clued with a _Fix Clue_ seems to be unrelated).
- Note that since we want to minimize _Lying_ as much as possible, _Finesses with a Lie Component_ have the **lowest possible precedence**. For example, this means that you can give a _Delayed Play Clue_ to a player who is still blind-playing cards without it looking like a _Fix Clue_.
- Importantly, _Finesses_ with a _Lie Component_ are **only** allowed if there is not an alternative line that would "get" the same number of cards without any lies. Thus, if you are looking to do a _Finesse_ with a _Lie Component_, make sure you carefully consider the efficiency of all of the possible alternatives.

### The Declined 5's Finesse

- The _5's Chop Move_ is typically used to save a 5 and a critical non-5 at the same time. This is very efficient, because it saves both cards with one clue instead of having to spend two clues.
- So, when a player has this strategy available, but instead declines to do it and clues the critical card on chop directly (without touching any other cards), then this is quite strange.
- In this situation, the player must be trying to communicate something extra. Similar to an _Occupied Finesse_, the player is trying to signal that this seemingly innocent _Save Clue_ is actually a _Play Clue_ instead. Someone on the team must have the cards to make this critical card playable.
- In some situations, the blind-player may have to defer playing into the _Finesse_ and instead give a _5 Save_ to the player with the (now) unsafe chop. If they do, then this is not a problem - the clue receiver can retroactively determine that a _Declined 5's Finesse_ has occurred and should not _stomp_ on the _Finesse_.

### The Rank Choice Save Finesse / The Rank Choice Save Bluff

- When saving a card, players have to choose carefully between using a color clue or a rank clue. However, in some rare situations, it makes absolutely no difference which clue is used:
  - Both color and rank would only touch the specific card.
  - Both color and rank would communicate the exact identity of the specific card.
  - Both color and rank would not give any useful negative information to the other cards in the hand.
- In these situations, the player giving the clue has a completely free choice between rank and color. We agree that by default, players should use color to save the card.
- If players instead use a rank clue to save the card, this communicates a _Rank Choice Save Finesse_.
- In the same way, it is also possible to perform a _Rank Choice Save Bluff_.
