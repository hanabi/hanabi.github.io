These are *Finesses* that are triggered by performing a suboptimal clue or by picking a strange choice for a clue.

<br />

### The Suboptimal Prompt & The Suboptimal Finesse & The Suboptimal Bluff

- The *Suboptimal Finesse* is covered at [level 19](../level-19.md#the-suboptimal-prompt--the-suboptimal-finesse--the-suboptimal-bluff).

<br />

### The Declined 5's Finesse

- The *5's Chop Move* is typically used to save a 5 and a critical non-5 at the same time. This is very efficient, because it saves both cards with one clue instead of having to spend two clues.
- So, when a player has this strategy available, but instead declines to do it and clues the critical card on chop directly (without touching any other cards), then this is quite strange.
- In this situation, the player must be trying to communicate something extra. Similar to an *Occupied Finesse*, the player is trying to signal that this seemingly innocent *Save Clue* is actually a *Play Clue* instead. Someone on the team must have the cards to make this critical card playable.
- In some situations, the blind-player may have to defer playing into the *Finesse* and instead give a *5 Save* to the player with the (now) unsafe chop. If they do, then this is not a problem - the clue receiver can retroactively determine that a *Declined 5's Finesse* has occurred and should not *stomp* on the *Finesse*.

### The Rank Choice Save Finesse

- When saving a card, players have to choose carefully between using a color clue or a rank clue. However, in some rare situations, it makes absolutely no difference which clue is used:
  - Both color and rank would only touch the specific card.
  - Both color and rank would communicate the exact identity of the specific card.
  - Both color and rank would not give any useful negative information to the other cards in the hand.
- In these situations, the player giving the clue has a completely free choice between rank and color. We agree that by default, players should use color to save the card.
- If players instead use a rank clue to save the card, this communicates a *Rank Choice Save Finesse*.
