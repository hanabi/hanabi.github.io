These are additional rules that can apply to _Ejections_, _Discharges_, and _Charms_.

<br />

### The Out-of-Position Ejection

- Normally, players are only allowed to perform an _Ejection_ on the very next player (similar to a _Bluff_).
- However, if an _Ejection_ is performed, and the very next player does not have a _Second Finesse Position_, then they cannot demonstrate to the team that an _Ejection_ is occurring.
- In this situation, the _Ejection_ is on the next player with a _Second Finesse Position_. The player being passed over knows that the next player will blind-play, so they can either discard or give an unrelated clue. After that, the next player should blind-play their card immediately to demonstrate what is going on.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's has three 5's in his hand in slot 2, slot 3, and slot 4. (They were clued with number 5 as a _5 Save_ earlier on in the game.)
  - Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 5 on his slot 1 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob does not see any connecting red cards in anybody's hand. Since the red 5 is three-away-from-playable, Bob knows that this must be a _5 Color Ejection_.
  - However, Bob does not have a _Second Finesse Position_. (He only has one unclued card in his hand.)
  - Thus, Bob knows that this is an _Out-of-Position 5 Color Ejection_ on Cathy.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays her _Second Finesse Position_ and it successfully plays as red 2.
  - Donald knows that since Cathy blind-played her _Second Finesse Position_ card, this must be a _5 Color Ejection_ and that his red card is the red 5.

- Note that you are not allowed to perform _Out-of-Position Ejections_ in reverse, unless it is super-obvious what is going on.
- Remember that just because _OOP Ejections_ are technically legal in some situations, this does **not** mean that players should use them. Just like any other complicated move, only use _OOP Ejections_ when it is super-clear to the rest of the team what is going on. Otherwise, a simpler line should be chosen.

<br />

### The Out-of-Position Discharge/Charm

- First, see the section on _[Out-of-Position Ejection](#the-out-of-position-ejection)_.
- Just like OOP _Ejection_, it is possible to do an OOP _Discharge_ or an OOP _Charm_ in the exact same way.

<br />

### The Stacked Ejection

- Normally, you are not allowed to perform a _Bluff_ on a player that is already "loaded" with a blind-play for a _Finesse_. (This is because the next player will allow for the possibility of a _Layered Finesse_, and the _Bluff_ will not resolve immediately.)
- Similarly, since _Ejections_ follow most of the same rules as _Bluffs_, you are not allowed to perform an _Ejection_ on a player that is already "loaded" with a blind-play for a _Finesse_.
- So, if a 5 was clued with color in this situation, the next player would assume a _Stacked Finesse_ instead of a _5 Color Ejection_. Thus, they would then play the card from the original _Finesse_ (or play nothing if the card from the original _Finesse_ is not yet playable).
- However, what if the next player can know that a _Stacked Finesse_ is impossible due to them not having enough possible cards to fulfill the _Finesse_? In this case, it would be a _Known Stacked 5 Color Ejection_.
- When this occurs, players should immediately play their _First Finesse Position_ (slot 2) instead of their _Second Finesse_ position (slot 3).
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks and it is the first turn of the game.
  - Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 2. This is a _Finesse_ on Cathy's red 1 (in her slot 1).
  - Bob clues blue to Donald, touching a blue 5.
  - Now, it is Cathy's turn. Cathy knows that she has a playable red 1, since no-one else on the team has a red 1.
  - Additionally, Cathy might think that Bob's clue was a _Stacked Finesse_ on the blue 5. However, this is impossible, because Cathy sees that no-one else on the team has any blue cards. Thus, for a _Stacked Finesse_ to be the case, Cathy would have to have red 1, blue 1, blue 2, blue 3, and blue 4, and Cathy only has 4 cards in her hand (since it is a 4-player game).
  - Since a _Stacked Finesse_ is impossible, Cathy knows that this must be a _Stacked 5 Color Ejection_.
  - Alice's clue _Finessed_ Cathy. So after Alice's clue, Cathy's _Finesse Position_ moved to her slot 2 and her _Second Finesse Position_ moved to her slot 3.
  - Normally, _Ejection_ calls for the _Second Finesse Position_, but in this case, Cathy knows that _Stacked 5 Color Ejections_ call for the _First Finesse Position_ instead of the _Second Finesse Position_, so Cathy blind-plays slot 2 (instead of slot 3).

<StackedEjection />

### The Stacked Discharge/Charm

- First, see the section on _[Stacked Ejection](#the-stacked-ejection)_.
- Just like _Stacked Ejection_, it is possible to do a _Stacked Discharge_ or a _Stacked Charm_ in the exact same way.

<br />

### The Double Ejection

- If a _Play Clue_ and an _Ejection_ are both possible as a 1-for-1, players are always expected to give a direct _Play Clue_. (We want to keep things simple and reduce the vector for mistakes to happen.)
- What happens if a player breaks this rule and does an _Ejection_ anyway? They must be trying to send an additional message.
- After Bob _Ejects_ in this situation, Cathy is expected to know that Alice really intended for a _Double Ejection_. Here, Cathy should also play her _Second Finesse Position_.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Donald has a globally-known red 2 in his hand. (It was given a _Play Clue_ earlier with a number 2 clue.)
  - Alice gives a red clue to Donald, filling in the 2 as a red 2.
  - Bob sees that since the red 2 was _already_ going to play on the stacks, Alice must be trying to communicate something extra. Normally, Bob would think that this is a _Replay Double Ignition_. However, it can't be that, because Cathy has a red 1 on her _Finesse Position_, which is trash.
  - Thus, Bob knows that Alice must be intend for a _Replay Ejection_ instead. Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_. It is a blue 1 and successfully plays.
  - Just like Bob, Cathy is able to see that Alice's clue was a _Replay Ejection_. However, Cathy also notices that blue 1 was not blocked, meaning that Alice could just given a blue clue to Bob as a direct _Play Clue_. Doing a _Replay Ejection_ in this situation does not make any sense.
  - Cathy knows that in this situation, Alice is intending for a _Double Ejection_. Cathy blind-plays her _Second Finesse Position_. It is a blue 2 and successfully plays.

<DoubleEjection />

- Situations that call for _Double Ejections_ are very similar to situations that call for _Double Ignitions_. Notice that if Cathy's _Finesse Position_ is a playable or a one-away-from-playable card, Alice's _Double Ejection_ would not work: Bob would blind-play his _Finesse Position_ as a _Double Ignition_. However, since Cathy does not have a playable, Bob thinks to himself: "Even though this clue is pretty weird, Alice is probably just doing an _Ejection_ as a 1-for-1 here because I have some blocking card in my hand." After Bob blind-plays his _Second Finesse Position_, Cathy sees that the move was _Unnecessary_. But unlike a normal _Unnecessary_ move (where Cathy would be expected to blind-play her _Finesse Position_ card), here Cathy knows that it makes more sense to blind-play her _Second Finesse Position_ card (since her _First Finesse Position_ card must be unplayable).
