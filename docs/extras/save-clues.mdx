### Saving Playable Cards when the Preceding Cards Are Not Promptable

- Often times, a player will have two similar clued cards in their hand with the leftmost being unplayable and the rightmost being playable. In this situation, the other members of the team cannot use a _Prompt_ to "get" the cards, since the leftmost would misplay.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Earlier on in the game, Bob was given a _2 Save_ clue. Now, he has a playable red 2 on his slot 5 and an unplayable blue 2 on his slot 4.
  - Cathy has a red 3 on her chop.
  - If Alice clued the red 3 in Cathy's hand, Bob would be _Prompted_ for slot 4, and blue 2 would misplay.

- In this example, Cathy's red 3 is in danger of being discarded soon, so Alice is in a rough spot. From _Save Principle_, Alice is expected to not let the playable red 3 get discarded. But cluing the red 3 would cause Bob to misplay the valuable blue 2.
- Players in this kind of situation will generally solve it in two ways:

#### A Tempo Clue + A Play Clue

- Two players can work together. One player can give a _Tempo Clue_ to the unpromptable card, and the other player can give a _Play Clue_ to the next card.
- Alternatively, one player can give a _Tempo Clue_ to the unpromptable card and assume that the player with the next card will give some clue. Later on, someone can clue the next card.

#### A Play Clue + A Fix Clue

- If the next player will not immediately misplay, then sometimes you can give the _Play Clue_ to the next card first.
- The other players on the team are expected to realize what is going on and help out by immediately giving a _Fix Clue_ to the _Prompted_ player before they misplay.
