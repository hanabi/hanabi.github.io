### 2 Saves Off Chop on the First Turn

- This convention only applies to 3-player games.
- On the first turn of the game, it is not possible to discard. If there is absolutely nothing else to do, it is permissible in this situation to use a number 2 clue to save a 2 that is **not** on chop, but only if the other players can see that you had no other choice.

### Saving Playable Cards when the Preceding Cards Are Not Promptable

- Often times, a player will have two similar clued cards in their hand with the left-most being unplayable and the right-most being playable. In this situation, the other members of the team cannot use a _Prompt_ to "get" the cards, since the left-most would misplay.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Earlier on in the game, Bob was given a _2 Save_ clue. Now, he has a playable red 2 on his slot 5 and an unplayable blue 2 on his slot 4.
  - Cathy has a red 3 on her chop.
  - If Alice clued the red 3 in Cathy's hand, Bob would be _Prompted_ for slot 4, and blue 2 would misplay.

- In this example, Cathy's red 3 is in danger of being discarded soon, so Alice is in a rough spot. From _Save Principle_, Alice is expected to not let the playable red 3 get discarded. But cluing the red 3 would cause Bob to misplay the valuable blue 2.
- Players in this kind of situation will generally solve it in two ways:

#### A Tempo Clue + A Play Clue

- Two players can work together. One player can give a _Tempo Clue_ to the unpromptable card, and the other player can give a _Play Clue_ to the next card.
- Alternatively, one player can give a _Tempo Clue_ to the unpromptable card and assume that the player with the next card will give some clue. Later on, someone can clue the next card.

#### A Play Clue + A Fix Clue

- If the next player will not immediately misplay, then sometimes you can give the _Play Clue_ to the next card first.
- The other players on the team are expected to realize what is going on and help out by immediately giving a _Fix Clue_ to the _Prompted_ player before they misplay.
