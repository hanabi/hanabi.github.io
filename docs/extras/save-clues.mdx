### The 5 Save

- The _5 Save_ is covered at [level 1](../level-1.mdx#the-5-save).

### The 2 Save

- The _2 Save_ is covered at [level 1](../level-1.mdx#the-2-save).

### The Locked Hand Save (LHS)

- The _Locked Hand Save_ is covered at [level 9](../level-9.mdx#the-locked-hand-save-lhs).

### The 8 Clue Save (8CS)

- The _8 Clue Save_ is covered at [level 9](../level-9.mdx#the-8-clue-save-8cs).

### The Fake Save

- We are only allowed to perform _Save Clues_ on specific cards and in specific ways, as outlined in [level 1](../level-1.mdx#save-clues). For example, we all agree that we must save 5's with number 5.
- In some specific circumstances, the team will have only one clue available and multiple cards must be saved with a single clue. In this situation, to prevent losing the game (or losing a currently-playable card), it is permissible to _Lie_ to the next player and perform a _Fake Save_ (e.g. a non-legal _Save Clue_).
- After a _Fake Save_, the player receiving the clue will mark their chop card as something other than what it really is. Thus, this move commits the team to giving a _Fix Clue_ to repair the _Lie_ at some point in the future.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice has 1 clue available.
  - Bob has a red 5 on chop, followed by a red 4. The other copy of the red 4 is in the discard pile, so there are two critical cards in a row.
  - Alice is not allowed to save the red 5 with a red clue, because then it would look like a _Save Clue_ on a red 4.
  - However, if Alice clues number 5 to Bob, then he will discard the red 4.
  - Thus, Alice performs a _Fake Save_ on both red cards by cluing red.
  - Bob will mark his chop as the red 4, so the team will have to give him a number 5 clue as a _Fix Clue_ at some point in the future. At that point, Bob will be surprised, but he will be able to retroactively see that Alice was in a very tight spot and had to give a _Fake Save_.

- _Fake Saves_ are **only allowed as a last resort**. If there is some other line that would "work", then players must use the other line. Because of this, _Fake Saves_ are extremely rare.

### Saving Playable Cards when the Preceding Cards Are Not Promptable

- Oftentimes, a player will have two similar clued cards in their hand with the leftmost being unplayable and the rightmost being playable. In this situation, the other members of the team cannot use a _Prompt_ to "get" the cards, since the leftmost would misplay.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Earlier on in the game, Bob was given a _2 Save_ clue. Now, he has a playable red 2 on his slot 5 and an unplayable blue 2 on his slot 4.
  - Cathy has a red 3 on her chop.
  - If Alice clued the red 3 in Cathy's hand, Bob would be _Prompted_ for slot 4, and blue 2 would misplay.

<SavingPlayableCards />

- In this example, Cathy's red 3 is in danger of being discarded soon, so Alice is in a rough spot. From _Save Principle_, Alice is expected to not let the playable red 3 get discarded. But cluing the red 3 would cause Bob to misplay the valuable blue 2.
- Players in this kind of situation will generally solve it in two ways:

#### A Tempo Clue + A Play Clue

- Two players can work together. One player can give a _Tempo Clue_ to the unpromptable card, and the other player can give a _Play Clue_ to the next card.
- Alternatively, one player can give a _Tempo Clue_ to the unpromptable card and assume that the player with the next card will give some clue. Later on, someone can clue the next card.

#### A Play Clue + A Fix Clue

- If the next player will not immediately misplay, then sometimes you can give the _Play Clue_ to the next card first.
- The other players on the team are expected to realize what is going on and help out by immediately giving a _Fix Clue_ to the _Prompted_ player before they misplay.
