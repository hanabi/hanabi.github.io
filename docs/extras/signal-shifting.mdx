title: Signal Shifting
---

- Nearly all clues send a distinct _Signal_ about the card that is focused:
  1. _Play_ the card
  1. _Save_ the card
  1. _Trash_ the card (rarely)
- Certain types of clues (likes _Finesses_ or _Bluffs_) can result in _Information Desynchronization_. In order to resynchronize the team, normal _Finesse Position_ blind-plays occur. After one or more blind-plays, the initial _Signal_ will be sufficiently clarified.
- But what if a clue is given such that a _Finesse Position_ blind-play will **never** clarify the _Signal_?
- In this situation, we agree that the next player should blind-play a card **other** than their regular _Finesse Position_. By doing so, they will _Shift_ the original _Signal_ in a fundamental way.
  - For example, in the _5 Color Ejection_, the original clue's _Signal Shifts_ from a _Play_ to a _Save_.
- This _Signal Shift_ can take two forms: _Ejection_ and _Discharge_.
- Just like a *Bluff*, all forms of *Signal Shifting* can only be performed on the very next player.
