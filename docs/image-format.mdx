## Intro

Throughout this website, we have example images that show game states. This page describes how to edit them or how to create new ones.

Each example image is created from a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file, which is a simple textual description that you can easily edit. The YAML files are located in the [`image-generator/yml`](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/tree/main/image-generator/yml) directory.

<br />

## Steps

<!-- lint disable ordered-list-marker-value -->

1. Put a new YAML file or edit an existing YAML file in the [`image-generator/yml`](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/tree/main/image-generator/yml) directory.

2. On the respective Markdown page, import it as a React component at the top of the file, like so:

```jsx
import NewChopMove from "@site/image-generator/yml/level-123/new-chop-move.yml";
```

(For an example of this, look at the Markdown page for [Level 1](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/docs/level-1.mdx).)

3. Insert the React component at the appropriate place in the Markdown file:

```jsx
<NewChopMove />
```

(For an example of this, look at the Markdown page for [Level 1](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/docs/level-1.mdx).)

## Development

When using the `run.sh` script and viewing the page locally, any changes that you make to the website will be automatically updated without having to refresh the page. This includes any changes to YAML files - they will be automatically re-converted into SVG files on the fly and updated in the browser.

## YML File Format

There are 2 main sections: `stacks` and `players`.

- `stacks` is an array of cards which have been played on the stacks already. The following suits are supported by default:
  - `r`: red,
  - `g`: green,
  - `b`: blue,
  - `y`: yellow,
  - `p`: purple,
  - `m`: rainbow (multicolor).
- `players` contains an entry for each player. Each entry contains the `cards` that they have in their hand.

<Example code={SimpleSource} Image={SimpleResult} />

Players are assigned the following names automatically: Alice, Bob, Cathy, Donald, and Emily. It is possible to override this with the `name` attribute. For example, this could be useful if Bob's hand is shown twice, before and after something happens.

`players` can also contain a `text` instead of `cards`. This is used to describe something that happens in a game.

<Example code={TextNameSource} Image={TextNameResult} />

<br />

### Cards

Cards in hand can be of various types:

- clued with known exact identity, e.g. `g2`
- clued with known suit, e.g. `b`
- clued with known rank, e.g. `4`
- clued with multiple possibilities, e.g. `b234`, `rm4`, `ym45`
- unclued card without any pips displayed, e.g. `x`
- unclued card with pips displayed, e.g. `xrg23`

`crossed_out` attribute can be used to mark some pips with X (when all other copies of that card are seen elsewhere).

The `orange` attribute can be used to draw some rank pips with orange. This is useful for pink cards.

By default, clued cards have an orange border, but this can be overridden with the `border` attribute.

The `trash` attribute can be used to draw a trash icon on top of the card.

<Example code={TypesSource} Image={TypesResult} />

<br />

### Clues

You can use the `clue` attribute to show that a card is in the process of being clued.

By default, there is no clue giver, but this can be specified with the `clue_giver` attribute.

You can also use the `retouched` attribute to signify that the clue is re-touching a card, which will result in a darker arrow than normal. (This matches the behavior of Hanab Live.)

<Example code={ClueSource} Image={ClueResult} />

<br />

### Text on Cards

Text can be placed on a card:

- `middle_note` to put a text label in the middle of the card
  - the string is automatically colored if it is a letter of one of the 5 suits
- `above` to put a note above the card
- `below` to put a note below the card

`above` and `below` have the same syntax:

- `above: Green 3` or `above: Rainbow 5` will draw the box with the specified color and text.
- Several more keywords have a specific color assigned to them: `Focus`, `Chop`.
- You can override the color using `color` attribute. CSS colors are accepted, and additionally `rainbow`.
- You can make it a multi-line note by using an array.
- It can be a list of such text boxes, potentially with different colors.

<Example code={CardTextSource} Image={CardTextResult} />

<br />

### Discard Pile

For some examples, some cards in the discard pile need to be shown. This is performed with the `discarded` array on the top level.

<Example code={TrashSource} Image={TrashResult} />

<br />

### Big Text

For keywords "Bluff", "Finesse" and "Illegal!", color is ignored.

<Example code={BigTextSource} Image={BigTextResult} />

<br />

### Variants

Some variant-specific suits can be added via `suits`, which contains the mapping from the letter indicating the suit to the part of the filenames of card images and pips.
Currently these variant suits are supported:

- black
- brown
- null (needs to be in quotes because normally `null` is a YAML keyword)
- omni
- pink
- prism-rygbp
- teal
- white

Standard suits don't need to be repeated in `suits`.

This is done to be able to differentiate between suits which commonly use the same letter, e.g. or "i" for both prism and pink.
