This page is a summary of the most commonly used conventions in the "Basic Strategies" section. It is intended to be used as a quick reference and overview, and does _not_ cover the details of each convention, edge cases, and so on. Moreover, it does not cover every single convention that is introduced in the document.

## Playing and saving cards

### Focus and clue interpretation

- Normally, every clue is focused on one specific card, which is the _Chop_ (oldest unclued card) if possible; otherwise it is the leftmost new card.
- We follow the _Good Touch Principle_, which is a promise that cards touched other than the focus will be eventually playable.
- Normally, every clue is either a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_.
- We can only give a _Save Clue_ to a card which is on chop, and only if it is a 5 (by number), a unique 2 (by number), or a critical card (by either number or color).

### Prompts and finesses

- A _Play Clue_ is a promise that a card is playable now. So in particular, any "connecting" cards are promised to the remaining teammates as well. For example, if a red 3 is given a _Play Clue_, and the red 1 and 2 have not been played yet, then the player giving the clue is _also_ making a promise that the other teammates have the red 1 and red 2.
- In such a situation, these teammates need to fulfill the promise of the clue giver by playing the connecting cards.
- They should first look among their clued cards for cards that match, and play those from left to right (called a [_Prompt_](level-1.mdx#the-prompt)). If there are no clued cards that match (or all matching cards have been played, and the promise is still not fulfilled), they should blind-play their _unclued_ cards from left to right until the promise is fulfilled (called a [_Finesse_](level-1.mdx#the-finesse)).
  - If there are potential _Prompts_ or _Finesses_, then other players may need to wait before playing their cards.
  - The _Double Prompt_, _Double Finesse_, _Reverse Finesse_, _Hidden Finesse_, _Layered Finesse_, and _Clandestine Finesse_ are all special cases of this general principle, but they each have separate names.

## Chop moves

- The H-Group has several conventions which can tell a player that a card on their _Chop_ is important and should not be discarded, even without touching the card with a clue. This is called a _[Chop Move](level-4.mdx#chop-moves)_.
- When a Chop Move occurs, the player considers the card on their chop to be touched with an "invisible" clue. Thus, their chop will "move" to the next right-most unclued card.
- Chop Moved cards don't count as "matching" for the purposes of _Prompts_.

### Types of chop moves

- The [_5's Chop Move_](level-4.mdx#the-5s-chop-move-5cm) is a number 5 clue that touches a 5 which is **one-away** from chop. In that case, we agree to also _Chop Move_ the _Chop_ card.

- The [_Trash Chop Move_](level-4.mdx#the-trash-chop-move) is a move in which a clue is given that touches only cards that are known to be trash. In that case, we agree to _Chop Move_ every card to the right of the rightmost trash card.

  - In expert play, there is a similar kind of move in which a card plays and is revealed to be a duplicate of an already globally known clued card in someone else's hand (rather than obviously known trash to be discarded). This is covered in the chapter on [_Dupe Tech_](level-17.mdx); such clues may or may not cause a _Chop Move_ depending on whether the complicated move also picked up any extra cards.

- A clue which only gets a **single** card to play that **already had a clue on it** is called [_Tempo Clue_](level-6.mdx#the-tempo-clue), and would normally not be worth giving. Thus, if the clue giver is not some dire situation, we agree the clue should also _Chop Move_ the player receiving the clue (because otherwise such clues are too wasteful). This is called a [_Tempo Clue Chop Move_](level-6.mdx#the-tempo-clue-chop-move-tccm).

- When a player receives a 1's clue at the beginning of the game, **the 1's that were in the starting hand should "normally" be played in a [special order](level-3.mdx#playing-multiple-1s)**:

  - If a 1 was on Chop at the start of the game, that 1 should be played first.
  - Any 1's that were drawn after the start of the game should be played from newest to oldest.
  - Any remaining 1's should be played from right to left.

  If the 1's are played in a **different order**, this triggers an [_Order Chop Move_](level-4.mdx#the-order-chop-move-ocm) based on the number of 1's which are "skipped" over: skipping over a single 1 Chop Moves the next player, skipping over two 1's Chop Moves the player after that, and so on.

- If Alice has a known playable card in their hand, and she chooses to discard her chop anyway instead of playing their card, then this signals to the team there is **some sort of emergency**. There are two common moves this corresponds to.

  - If the team has 0 clues and Bob has a playable or critical card on his chop, this triggers a [_Scream Discard Chop Move_](level-7.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm) on Bob. the purpose of Alice's discard is to prevent Bob from discarding. So, Bob should _Chop Move_ once.
  - Bob is also required to **not** discard on the turn he is screamed at (because he could have multiple critical cards), and can stall if necessary.
  - If the team has 0 clues and Cathy has a playable or critical card on her chop, and does not have something to do, we instead consider this a [_Generation Discard_](level-7.mdx#the-generation-discard); the purpose of Alice's discard is to generate a clue so that Bob can save Cathy's card.

- When a player has multiple known-trash cards, they are normally expected to discard **known trash from left to right**. Skipping over trash cards triggers a [_Trash Order Chop Move_](level-14.mdx#the-trash-order-chop-move-tocm) similarly to an _Order Chop Move_.

## Discarding

### Discarding clued non-trash cards

- If a player discards a known non-trash card, it promises **someone else has the other copy**.
- Like with prompts vs finesses, clued cards that match should first be considered. In ideal situations, this doesn't happen because the _Good Touch_ prohibits cluing both copies of the same card, but sometimes it could happen due to a mistake or an awkward situation. In this case, we call this move a [_Sarcastic Discard_](level-3.mdx#the-sarcastic-discard). Such a discard is useful because it resynchronizes the team, communicating to the other players and preventing potential confusion.
- Otherwise, it promises the other copy in someone's _Finesse Position_. This is called either a [_Gentleman's Discard_](level-10.mdx#the-gentlemans-discard) or [_Baton Discard_](level-10.mdx#-the-baton-discard), depending on whether the card is already playable or not.

### Double discard avoidance

- A _Double Discard situation_ is one where the previous player discards (or misplays) a card; **and** the current player could be discarding the other copy of that card.
- If the team is unlucky, this could lose the game. So, we agree to treat this as a "stalling" situation as well.
- If advanced H-group features are turned on in hanab.live, _Double Discard_ situations will be indicated by a different discard sound effect, a yellow border around the discard pile, and small blue question marks on cards which might match the card just discarded or misplayed.
- In [hard variants](variant-specific.mdx#hard-variants--easy-variants), _Double Discard Avoidance_ is turned off.

### Elimination notes

- Sometimes a player can realize that they must have a specific card somewhere in their hand. For example:
  - If nothing special is happening, and a player sees a playable card or a 2 get unexpectedly discarded, it follows someone has the other copy.
  - If a player discards when they should be in _Double Discard Avoidance_, it follows someone has the other copy of the card that initiated the _Double Discard_ situation.
- In that case, one player should make notes on all cards in their hand for the "missing" card.
- These cards notes can be used to make deductions, sometimes even letting the card blind-play "for free". This is covered in the chapter on [Elimination](level-18.mdx).

## Stalling

- There are some situations in which the team might need to "stall" by giving a low-value clue. In order of severity, such situations include:
  - Severity 1: The _Early Game_ is the period of time before the **first unknown discard**. We agree to allow _5 Stalls_ (defined below) to extend the _Early Game_ a bit longer than would normally occur if only normal _Play Clues_ and _Save Clues_ are allowed.
  - Severity 2: _Double Discard situations_ and _Scream Discards_, which were defined above.
  - Severity 3: A _Locked Hand_ is one where every card is clued or _Chop Moved_. In this case, a player cannot discard safely, so they are allowed to stall instead.
  - Severity 4: The game rules prohibit discarding if the team already has 8 clues.
- There is a [big stall table](level-9.mdx#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table) which indicates what kind of stalls are permitted at what severities, and what their precedence is. This fairly strict table makes it easier to distinguish between stall clues and things like _Finesses_.
- The types of stalls covered in the table are summarized below:
  - A [_5 Stall_](level-2.mdx#the-5-stall-cluing-off-chop-5s) is the most preferred kind of stall, and available in any situation where no normal _Play Clues_ or _Save Clues_ are allowed. It simply consists of giving a 5's clue to a 5 which is off-chop. It does not trigger a _5's Chop Move_.
  - At Severity 2 and higher, one can give a _Tempo Clue Stall_ by re-cluing a card to make it play; this does not trigger a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_.
  - If there are no valid _5 Stalls_ or _Tempo Clue Stalls_, then:
    - At Severity 2 and higher, one can also simply _fill-in_ a card (giving extra information to already-clued or chop moved cards).
    - At Severity 3 or higher, a player can save any card on chop, even if it is not critical or playable. This is called a [_Locked Hand Save_](level-9.mdx#locked-hands-severity-3-stalling).
    - At Severity 4 or higher, a player can save any card not on slot 1, even if it is not critical or playable. This is called an [_8 Clue Save_](level-9.mdx#clues-given-while-at-8-clues-severity-4-stalling).
  - At Severity 2 or higher, if no other types of stalls are available, the player can _Hard Burn_ by spending a clue to provide no new information (e.g. re-cluing a known unplayable 5).

### End-Game

- In the _End-Game_, stalling is often necessary in order to win the game before time runs out. Because _End-Game_ strategy is so complicated, the stalling table does not prescribe conventions for what is and isn't legal, and players need to instead use context and common sense.
- In the _End-Game_, when almost all cards are trash, a player can also opt to discard an unclued card off their chop to communicate the position of a card to their teammate: for example, discarding slot 2 for no apparent reason tells the team that a player has a playable card on slot 2. This is called a [_Positional Discard_](level-8.mdx#the-positional-discard-indicating-a-play-with-a-discard).
  - If a _Positional Discard_ wouldn't work, for example because there are are multiple players with a card on a given slot or if the desired slot is the usual Chop, one can expend a strike to use a [_Positional Misplay_](level-8.mdx#the-positional-misplay-indicating-a-play-with-a-misplay) instead.
