- Enumerate all of the legal clues that Alice can give.
- Of these possibilities, what clue should Alice give?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice can clue yellow to Bob as a *Play Clue* on the yellow 3 (through Cathy's yellow 2).
- Alice can clue number 3 to Bob as a *Play Clue* on the yellow 3 (through Cathy's yellow 2).
- Alice can clue number 5 to Bob as a *5 Save* on the blue 5.
- Normally, Alice would prefer to give a *Play Clue* over a *Save Clue*. However, in this case, her *Play Clue* would be a *Delayed Play Clue*, because Bob would not be able to play the card yet. (Bob would have to wait for Cathy to play the yellow 2.)
- So, if Alice gave a *Play Clue* to the yellow 3, then Bob might have nothing to do and might discard the critical blue 5. This means that Alice must perform some other action.
- Thus, Alice should clue number 5 to Bob as a *5 Save*.
