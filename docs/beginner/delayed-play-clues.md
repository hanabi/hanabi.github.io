- It's permitted to give a *Play Clue* to a card that will only successfully play on the stacks *after* other people have played cards of the same suit.
  - We refer to such a clue as a *Delayed Play Clue* when the card is only playable *through* other cards that are going to play.
- We agree to treat **all *Play Clues*** as **potential *Delayed Play Clues***.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice clues Bob number 2, which is a *Play Clue* on a 2.
  - Now, it is Bob's turn. If his 2 is the red 2, then he can play it right now.
  - However, Bob also knows that this could be a *Delayed Play Clue* through the yellow 1, the green 1, or the blue 1. So, Bob must wait for Cathy to play all of her 1's first before he can try to play the 2.
  - Bob discards.
