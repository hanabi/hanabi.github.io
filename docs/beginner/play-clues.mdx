- The first type of clue is called a _Play Clue_.
- The goal of Hanabi is to get all of the cards played on the stacks. Thus, we give _Play Clues_ to each other to communicate that specific cards are playable.
- Here, Alice clues red to Bob, touching a card on slot 2.
- This is a message to "play this card". Thus, it must be the red 1 (because no red cards are played on the stacks yet).
- After the clue, all players make a note on the card that it is a red 1.

- _Play Clues_ can be given with either a color clue or a number clue.
- Here, Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching a card on slot 3.
- Similar to before, this is a message to "play this card". Thus, it must be a yellow 1 or a blue 1 (since those are the only two 1's that are not played yet).
- After the clue, all players make a note on the card that it is yellow 1 or a blue 1.
