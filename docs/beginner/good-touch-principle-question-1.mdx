- What action should Alice perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice needs to give a _Play Clue_ to Bob's blue 3 before it is discarded.
- If Alice clues blue, then it would focus the blue 3, but the blue 2 would be duplicated (because it is already played on the stacks).
- If Alice clues number 3, then it would focus the blue 3, but it would also touch the red 3. The red 3 is useful to the team in the future, so this is a good thing.
- Thus, Alice should clue number 3 to Bob.
