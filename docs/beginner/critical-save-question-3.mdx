- Alice clues yellow to Bob, touching a card on slot 4.
- Is this a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_?
- What _card note_ does Bob write? (Be specific.)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Bob knows that this could be a _Play Clue_ on the yellow 1.
- However, since it touched his chop, it could also be a _Save Clue_. Since yellow 3 and yellow 4 are in the trash, a yellow clue matches those cards, so it could be yellow 3 or yellow 4.
- Bob then notices that Cathy has a yellow 3 in her hand. Since there are only two copies of yellow 3 in the deck, Bob cannot have the yellow 3.
- Bob does not know whether or not this is a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_, but he has to treat it as a _Save Clue_ for the time being until he gets more information.
- Bob writes a _card note_ that includes the following identities:
  - yellow 1 (as a _Play Clue_)
  - yellow 4 (as a _Critical Save_)
