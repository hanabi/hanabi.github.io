- Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a card on slot 3.
- Is this a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*?
- What *card note* does Bob write?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Bob knows that this could be a *Play Clue* on:
  - a yellow 3 (directly playable)
  - a red 3 (as a *Delayed Play Clue* through Cathy's red 2)
- However, since it touched his chop, it could also be a *Save Clue*. Since green 3 is in the trash, a number 3 clue matches that, so it could be the matching green 3.
- Bob does not know whether or not this is a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*, but he has to treat it as a *Save Clue* for the time being until he gets move information.
- Bob writes a *card note* of "yellow 3, red 3, green 3".
