- Alice clues yellow to Cathy, touching a yellow 4 as a _Play Clue_.
- From Bob's perspective, is this a _Finesse_? Why or why not?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- No, it is not a _Finesse_.
- Bob has a clued 3 in his hand, which could be the yellow 3. Therefore, this could be a _Prompt_ on Bob.
- Bob knows that _Prompts_ take precedence over _Finesses_. Since a _Prompt_ is possible, it cannot be a _Finesse_.
