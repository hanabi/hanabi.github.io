- Fundamentally, Hanabi is all about giving clues. Different groups have different definitions of what clues should mean.
- In our group, clues **always** have a specific meaning.
- Players are **only** allowed to give **two types of clues**:
  - a _Play Clue_ (meaning to play the focused card)
  - a _Save Clue_ (meaning to save the focused card for later)
- If players cannot give a valid _Play Clue_ or a valid _Save Clue_, then they **must discard**.
- Let's go through _Play Clues_ and _Save Clues_ individually.
