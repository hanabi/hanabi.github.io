- Cathy has a completely unclued hand.
- Alice clues green to Cathy, touching slot 3 and slot 4.

1. What slot is focused?
1. Is this a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_?
1. What _card note_ does Cathy write on the focused card?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

1. Slot 4 is focused (i.e. the chop card).
1. Since green 2 is played on the stacks, the card on slot 4 must be either a green 3, a green 4, or a green 5.
   - If it is a green 3, then this would be a _Chop-Focus Play Clue_. That is legal.
   - If it is a green 4, then it wouldn't make any sense, because green 4 is neither playable nor critical. (All clues must either be _Play Clues_ or _Save Clues_.)
   - If it is a green 5, then it wouldn't make any sense, because green 5 is not playable. Green 5 is critical, but it must be saved with a number 5 clue as a _5 Save_.
   - Thus, it must be a _Chop-Focus Play Clue_ on the green 3.
1. Cathy writes a _card note_ of "green 3" on her slot 4 card.
