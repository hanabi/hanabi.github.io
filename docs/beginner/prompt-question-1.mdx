- Bob has two unknown 2's previously clued in his hand.
- Cathy has an unknown 5 and an unknown 4 previously clued in her hand.
- Alice clues red to Cathy.
- What is Bob's interpretation of Alice's clue?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Since the red 3 is in this trash, this is a _Critical Save_ on the red 3 (i.e. a _Save Clue_).
- Bob should therefore not react in any way.
- If the red 3 were not in the trash, then it would be a _Prompt_ on Bob's left-most 2.
