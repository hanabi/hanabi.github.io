- In general, players can use the three main principles to guide their actions:
  - *Good Touch Principle*
  - *Save Principle*
  - *Minimum Clue Value Principle*
- But besides that, here are some other things that you should get in the habit of thinking about.

<br />

### Check Team Chops

- The first thing you should do on your turn is to **look at the chop cards of everyone on the team**.
- Are there any cards on chop that need to be saved (or played)? If so, do you have to do it, or can someone else do it?
  - If no-one else can do it, then you need to give the *Save Clue* (or *Play Clue*), even if you have a card to play.
  - If someone else can do it, would it be better for you to save the card, or for them? If they have a card to play and you do not have a card to play, then it is better teamwork for you to save the card.

<br />

### Give *Play Clues* Over *Save Clues*

- If a player could be given a *Play Clue* **or** a *Save Clue*, then just give them a *Play Clue*.
- There's no need to save a card now if you can preoccupy the player with playing a card!

<br />

### Prefer Color Clues

- In general, if you have a choice, **color clues should be given over number clues**. This is because color clues are usually more specific, telling the player the exact identity of the card.
- Of course, don't be afraid to disregard this advice and use number clues if it "gets" additional cards or it helps to "fill in" other cards in the hand.

<br />

### Discard Without Fear

- **Don't be afraid of discarding**. If you discard something important, it won't be your fault - it is your teammates' responsibility to save any important cards.
