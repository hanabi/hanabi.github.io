- It is currently the *Early Game*. There is 1 clue token left.
- What action should Alice perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- At Level 1, there is no legal action that can be performed.
  Therefore, Alice must discard.
- Starting from Level 2, there is a special move called the *5 Stall*
  in which Alice clues 5 to Donald (touching the purple 5)
  to prolong the *Early Game* slightly. However, you don't have to worry about this at Level 1.
