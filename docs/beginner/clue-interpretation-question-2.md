- Bob has a completely unclued hand.
- Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching slot 5.

1. What slot is focused?
1. Is this a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*?
1. What *card note* does Bob write on his slot 5 card?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

1. Slot 5 is focused.
1. This is a *Play Clue*.
    - (Normally, this would look like a *2 Save* clue, but all of the 2's are currently playable. So it can't be a *2 Save* and is just a simple *Play Clue* instead.)
1. Bob writes a *card note* of "yellow 2, green 2, blue 2".
