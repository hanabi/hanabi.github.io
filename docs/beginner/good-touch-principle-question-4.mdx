- Green 3 needs be played on the stacks.
- What action should Alice perform?
- If Alice should give a clue, what card note will be written on the focused card?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Both a color and number clue would duplicate the green 3 and violate _Good Touch Principle_.
- Thus, Alice should wait patiently for Bob to discard the green 3. Once the first copy of the green 3 is discarded, the team can clue the remaining green 3.
- Since there are no legal clues to give, Alice must discard.
