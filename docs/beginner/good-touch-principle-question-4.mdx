<TabItem value="solution">

- Both a color and number clue would duplicate the green 3 and violate _Good Touch Principle_.
- Thus, Alice should wait patiently for Bob to discard the green 3. Once the first copy of the green 3 is discarded, the team can clue the remaining green 3.
- Since there are no legal clues to give, Alice must discard.
