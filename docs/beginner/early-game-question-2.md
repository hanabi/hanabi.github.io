- It is currently the *Early Game*. There is 1 clue token left.
- Previously, Bob was clued about some 1's. He will go on to play the purple 1 and the green 1 in the future.
- What action should Alice perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- The **only** legal action that Alice can perform is to clue green to Bob as a *Delayed Play Clue* on the green 2.
  - Other than this green clue, there are no other possible legal clues to give.
  - Alice is not allowed to discard because it is the *Early Game* and all of the *Play Clues* have not been extinguished yet.
