- From Bob's perspective, is this a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_?
- What _card note_ does Bob write?

<TabItem value="solution">

- This cannot be a _Save Clue_ because the clue did not touch the card on Bob's chop. Thus, it must be a _Play Clue_.
- Bob writes a _card note_ that includes the following identities:
  - yellow 2 (as a _Delayed Play Clue_ through Cathy's yellow 1)
  - blue 2 (directly playable)
