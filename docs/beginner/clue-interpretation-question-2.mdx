- Bob has a completely unclued hand.
- Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching slot 5.

1. What slot is focused?
1. Is this a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_?
1. What _card note_ does Bob write on his slot 5 card?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

1. Slot 5 is focused.
1. This is a _Play Clue_.
   - (Normally, this would look like a _2 Save_ clue, but all of the 2's are currently playable. So it can't be a _2 Save_ and is just a simple _Play Clue_ instead.)
1. Bob writes a _card note_ of "yellow 2, green 2, blue 2".
