- Enumerate all of the legal clues that Alice can give.
- Of these possibilities, what clue should Alice give?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice can clue blue to Bob as a _Play Clue_ on the blue 2.
  - If she did that, Bob would write a _card note_ of "blue 2".
- Alice can clue number 2 to Bob as a _Play Clue_ on the blue 2.
  - If she did that, Bob would write a _card note_ of "yellow 2, blue 2, purple 2".
- By default, Alice knows that color clues should be preferred over number clues. Specifically, in this situation, Alice knows that a blue clue will communicate the exact identity of the card, while a number clue would communicate three different possibilities.
- Thus, Alice should give a blue clue to Bob.
