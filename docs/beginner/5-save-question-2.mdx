- What action should Alice perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Bob has two 5's, but neither of them are on chop, so they cannot be saved yet.
- Cathy has a 5 and it is on chop.
  - (Her chop is slot 2 because the cards on slot 3 and slot 4 have a clue on them.)
- Donald has one 5, but it is not on chop, so it cannot be saved yet.
- Thus, Alice should clue number 5 to Cathy as a _5 Save_.
