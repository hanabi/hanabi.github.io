- What action should Alice perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Bob has a yellow 2 on chop, which would normally need to be saved, but Cathy already has the other copy clued in her hand, so Bob's yellow 2 is trash and should be ignored.
- Bob has two 5's, but neither of them are on chop, so they cannot be saved yet.
- Cathy has two 5's. One of them is already saved (i.e. has a clue on it), but one of them is not already saved and is on chop.
  - (Her chop is slot 2 because the cards on slot 3 and slot 4 have a clue on them.)
- Donald has one 5, but it is not on chop, so it cannot be saved yet.
- Thus, Alice should clue number 5 to Cathy as a _5 Save_ on the yellow 5.
