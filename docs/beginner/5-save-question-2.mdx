- List all of the legal actions that Alice can perform.
- What action should Alice perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Bob has a yellow 2 on chop, which would normally need to be saved. However, Cathy already has the other copy clued in her hand, so Bob's yellow 2 is trash and should be ignored.
- Bob also has two 5's, but neither of them are on chop, so they cannot be saved yet.
- Cathy has two 5's. One of them is already saved (i.e. has a clue on it), but one of them is not already saved and is on chop.
  - (Her chop is slot 2 because the cards on slot 3 and slot 4 have a clue on them.)
- Thus, the actions that Alice can perform are:
  - to save Cathy's 5
  - to discard
- But which is better? In this situation, either Alice or Bob can save Cathy's 5:
  - If Alice save's Cathy's 5, then Bob would discard a yellow 2 (which is trash).
  - If Alice discards, then she would discard an unknown card, and Bob would save Cathy's 5.
- Since discarding trash is better than discarding an unknown card, Alice should give the clue to let Bob discard.
