- What action should Alice perform?
- If Alice should give a clue, what *card note* will be written on the focused card? (Be specific.)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice needs to give a *Play Clue* to Bob's red 2 before it is discarded.
- If Alice clues red, then it would focus the red 2, but the red 4 would be duplicated (because it is already clued in Cathy's hand).
- If Alice clues number 2, then it would only touch the red 2.
- Thus, Alice should clue number 2 to Bob.
- Bob will write a *card note* with the following identities:
  - red 2 (as a *Play Clue*)
  - yellow 2 (as a *2 Save*)
- (Bob knows that it cannot be a *2 Save* on a green 2 because that card is present in Cathy's hand and it is not on chop yet.)
