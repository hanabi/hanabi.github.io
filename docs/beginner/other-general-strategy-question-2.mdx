- It is the _Early Game_.
- Enumerate all of the legal clues that Alice can give.
- Of these possibilities, what clue should Alice give?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice can clue green to Cathy as a _Play Clue_ on the green 3.
- Alice can clue number 5 to Cathy as a _5 Save_ on the red 5.
- It makes more sense for Alice to give the _Play Clue_ instead of the _Save Clue_, since Cathy won't be discarding anything on her turn if she is preoccupied with playing a card.
