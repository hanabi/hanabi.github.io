- Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a card on slot 3.
- Is this a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_?
- What _card note_ does Bob write?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Bob knows that this could be a _Play Clue_ on:
  - a yellow 3 (directly playable)
  - a red 3 (as a _Delayed Play Clue_ through Cathy's red 2)
- However, since it touched his chop, it could also be a _Save Clue_. Since green 3 is in the trash, a number 3 clue matches that, so it could be the matching green 3.
- Bob does not know whether or not this is a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_, but he has to treat it as a _Save Clue_ for the time being until he gets more information.
- Bob writes a _card note_ of "yellow 3, red 3, green 3".
