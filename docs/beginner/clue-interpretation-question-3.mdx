- Bob has a clued 2 and a clued 5 in his hand.
- Alice clues red to Bob, touching slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.

1. What slot is focused?
1. Is this a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_?
1. What _card note_ does Bob write on the focused card?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

1. Slot 3 is focused (i.e. the "new" card that was on chop).
1. Red 1 is played on the stacks and Bob already has a red 2 and a red 5. Thus, the focused red card can be either a red 3 or a red 4.
   - If it is a red 3, then this would be a _Chop-Focus Delayed Play Clue_ through his own red 2. That is legal.
   - If it is a red 4, then it wouldn't make any sense, because red 4 is neither playable nor critical. (All clues must either be _Play Clues_ or _Save Clues_.)
   - Thus, it must be a _Chop-Focus Delayed Play Clue_ on the red 3.
1. Bob writes a _card note_ of "red 3" on his slot 3 card.
