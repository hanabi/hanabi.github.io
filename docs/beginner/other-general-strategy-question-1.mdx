- It is Alice's turn and she has a yellow 2 to play.
- Cathy has a critical blue 5 on chop.
- Should Alice play the yellow 2 or save Cathy's blue 5?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice has a playable card and Bob doesn't have anything to do.
- Thus, it would be bad teamwork for Alice to save Cathy's blue 5.
- Alice should play the yellow 2 and let Bob handle saving Cathy's blue 5.
