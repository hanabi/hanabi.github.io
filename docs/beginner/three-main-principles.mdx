- So far, we have covered:
  - how to discard (i.e. the chop)
  - how to tell what a clue means (i.e. a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_)
  - how to tell what the focus of a clue is (i.e. _Chop-Focus_ or leftmost)
- But that doesn't really tell you much about the _strategy_ involved in playing Hanabi. How do players find the best move for a certain situation?
- Hanabi is very complicated, so it is impossible to write a guide on how to find the best move. (And that's a good thing, because the game continues to be interesting to play, even after thousands of games!)
- Luckily, beginners can focus on internalizing just **three main principles**:
  1. _Good Touch Principle_
  1. _Save Principle_
  1. _Minimum Clue Value Principle_
- Let's go through each principle individually.
