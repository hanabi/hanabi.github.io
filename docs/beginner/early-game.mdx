- In Hanabi, the beginning of the game can be stressful - there can be a lot of important cards on chop. For this reason, it is nice if players can be certain that their teammates will give a clue instead of discarding.
- We formalize this concept as _The Early Game_. The _Early Game_ is defined as the period of time before someone discards for the first time. When they do, they initiate the _Mid-Game_.
- Everyone agrees that they **must** "extinguish" all of the available _Play Clues_ and _Save Clues_ before initiating the _Mid-Game_. (There are no cards in the discard pile yet, but _Save Clues_ still need to be given to all of the 5's on chop and all of the 2's on chop that are not present in someone else's hand.)
