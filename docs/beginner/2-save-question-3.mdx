- Alice is not allowed to perform a _2 Save_ on Bob's green 2 because the other copy of the green 2 is present in Cathy's hand and is not on chop.
- Alice is not allowed to perform a _2 Save_ on Cathy's yellow 2 because the other copy of the yellow 2 is present in Bob's hand and is not on chop.
- Alice is not allowed to perfrom a _5 Stall_ on Cathy's yellow 5 because it is not the _Early Game_ or some other situation in which giving a _5 Stall_ would be legal.
