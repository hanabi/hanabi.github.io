## Clue Interpretation Algorithm

When a clue happens and you need to figure out what it means, **always ask yourself the following questions**:

1. What slot is focused?
    - Use the 4-step process we covered in the previous section.
1. Is it a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue* or could it be both?
    - Non-chop clues are always *Play Clues*.
    - Chop clues can be either a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*.
1. What is the identity of the card?
    - Based on whether it is a *Play Clue* or *Save Clue*, record all of the possibilities as a *card note*.

Follow this algorithm every time! Don't skip a step!
