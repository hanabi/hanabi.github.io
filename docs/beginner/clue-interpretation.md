## Clue Overview

In conclusion, there are:

1. _Play Clues_
   - normal _Play Clues_
   - _Delayed Play Clues_
1. _Save Clues_
   - the _5 Save_
   - the _2 Save_

And only one card is _focused_ by a clue.

## Clue Interpretation Algorithm

When a clue happens and you need to figure out what it means, **always ask yourself the following questions**:

1. What slot is focused?
   - Use the 4-step process we covered in the previous section.
1. Is it a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_ or could it be both?
   - Non-chop clues are always _Play Clues_.
   - Chop clues can be either a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_.
1. What is the identity of the card?
   - Based on whether it is a _Play Clue_ or _Save Clue_, record all of the possibilities as a _card note_.

Follow this algorithm every time! Don't skip a step!
