- In Hanabi, the beginning of the game can be stressful - there can be a lot of important cards on chop. For this reason, it is nice if players can be certain that their teammates will give a clue instead of discarding.
- We formalize this concept as *The Early Game*. The *Early Game* is defined as the period of time before someone discards for the first time. When they do, they initiate the *Mid-Game*.
- Everyone agrees that they **must** "extinguish" all of the available *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* before initiating the *Mid-Game*. (There are no cards in the discard pile yet, but *Save Clues* still need to be given to all of the 5's on chop and all of the 2's on chop that are not present in someone else's hand.)
- Furthermore, in the *Early Game*, you can do a special move called a *5 Stall*; see below.

<br />

### The 5 Stall (Cluing Off Chop 5's)

- Normally, you are only allowed to give a *Save Clue* to a 5 if it is on chop. So if you use number 5 to clue a 5 that is **not** on chop, then it will typically look like a *Play Clue* on that 5 (or some other advanced strategy).
- As a special exception, in the *Early Game*, you **are** allowed to clue number 5 as a *Save Clue* to off chop 5's. Doing this is just interpreted as a "stall" clue and that you are trying to extend the *Early Game* for a little bit longer.
- However, you are **only** allowed to do this if there is nothing else to do, meaning that all of the "normal" *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* have been extinguished.
- Normally, *5 Stalls* are only performed in the *Early Game*. However, you might see someone do a *5 Stall* in the *Mid-Game* if they are in a special situation where they are not allowed to discard.
