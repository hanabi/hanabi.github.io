- In Hanabi, the beginning of the game can be stressful - there can be a lot of important cards on chop. For this reason, it is nice if players can be certain that their teammates will give a clue instead of discarding.
- We formalize this concept as *The Early Game*. The *Early Game* is defined as the period of time before someone discards for the first time. When they do, they initiate the *Mid-Game*.
- Everyone agrees that they **must** "extinguish" all of the available *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* before initiating the *Mid-Game*. (There are no cards in the discard pile yet, but *Save Clues* still need to be given to all of the 5's on chop and all of the 2's on chop that are not present in someone else's hand.)
