- Cathy has two unknown 3's in her hand.
- What are the two possible clues that Alice can give?
- Which one is better and why?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- First, Alice can clue yellow to Bob:
  - This would be a _Play Clue_ on the yellow 4, which would _Prompt_ Cathy.
  - Cathy would play her left-most 3 and then stop.
- Second, Alice can also clue blue to Bob:
  - This would be a _Play Clue_ on the blue 4, which would _Prompt_ Cathy.
  - Cathy would try to play blue 3 from slot 3. However, it would be yellow 3, which would successfully play.
  - Cathy would know that she is promised to have the blue 3, so she would go on to play her other 3 as the blue 3.
- The second clue is better than the first clue because it gets Cathy to play two cards instead of one.
