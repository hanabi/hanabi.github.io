- Critical cards are defined as cards that have all other copies discarded.
- For the same reason that 5's need to be saved, critical cards also need to be saved.
- We agree that players can save critical cards with **either a color clue or a number clue**.
- In the example below:
  - Alice clues Bob blue, which touches a card on slot 4.
  - Before this clue, the only clued card in Bob's hand was the 5 on slot 5.
  - Bob's first instinct is that this could be a *Play Clue* on the blue 2. However, since the clue was focused on his chop, this could also be a *Save Clue*.
  - Bob looks through the discard pile and finds that there is a blue 4 there. Thus, this could be a *Save Clue* on the blue 4. So, Bob knows that for now, he has to hold on to the card.
  - Bob marks the card as either a blue 2 or a blue 4, so that he can keep track of it for later. Then, he discards.
