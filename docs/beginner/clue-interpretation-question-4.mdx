- Bob has a clued 2 in this hand.
- Alice clues blue to Bob, touching slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.

1. What slot is focused?
1. Is this a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_?
1. What _card note_ does Bob write on the focused card?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

1. Slot 4 is focused (i.e. the "new" card that was on chop).
1. Blue 1 is played on the stacks and Bob already has a blue 2. Thus, the focused blue card can be either a blue 3, a blue 4, or a blue 5.
   - If it is a blue 3, then this would be a _Chop-Focus Delayed Play Clue_ through his own blue 2. That is legal.
   - If it is a blue 4, then this would be a _Critical Save_ on the blue 4.
   - If it is a blue 5, then it wouldn't make any sense, because blue 5 is not playable. Blue 5 is critical, but it must be saved with a number 5 clue as a _5 Save_.
   - Thus, this can either be a _Chop-Focus Delayed Play Clue_ on the blue 3 or a _Critical Save_ on the blue 4.
1. Bob writes a _card note_ of "blue 3, blue 4" on his slot 4 card.

- Note that before this clue, Bob was not able to play the 2 in his hand, because it could have been the yellow 2 (which is not playable).
- This blue clue "filled in" his 2 to be the blue 2, so now Bob can go ahead and play it.
- However, this does **not** make the clue a _Play Clue_. Since it was focused on slot 4, it is first and foremost a potential _Save Clue_ that happened to have a "side-effect" of making the blue 2 playable. (Blue 2 was not the focus of the clue.)
