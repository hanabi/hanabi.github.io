- In Hanabi, there is only one copy of each 5. So, we need to stop players from discarding them.
- We agree that 5's should be saved with **a number 5 clue**. This is called a *5 Save*.
- In the example below:
  - Alice clues Bob number 5, which touches a single 5 on slot 5.
  - Before this clue, Bob did not have any clued cards in his hand.
  - Since the clue was focused on his chop, Bob knows that this must be a *5 Save* on the 5. It can be any 5 in the game.

<FiveSave />

- 5's **must be saved with a number clue** instead of a color clue. (Otherwise, it will look like a *Play Clue*!)
