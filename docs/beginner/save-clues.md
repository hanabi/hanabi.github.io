- The second type of clue is called a *Save Clue*.
- In Hanabi, there are only so many copies of a particular card. If all copies of a card are discarded, then it is impossible to get the maximum score. Thus, we give *Save Clues* to communicate that specific cards should be saved for later.

<br />

### On Chop Cards Only

- *Save Clues* **can only be given to cards on chop**.
  - So, if a clue is focused on a non-chop card, then it must be a *Play Clue* instead.

<br />

### List of Savable Cards

- The team **must save** the following cards (and are **only allowed** to save the following cards):
  - All 5's
  - Unique 2's (i.e. 2's that are the only copy currently visible)
  - Critical cards (i.e. cards that have all other copies discarded)
- The reason for saving 5's and critical cards is obvious: if they are discarded, the maximum score lowers.
- The reason for saving 2's is not obvious. We agree to treat 2's similar to critical cards because they are really important for consistently getting the maximum score.

### Sometimes You Won't Know, So Hold It

- Sometimes, a clue that focuses the chop card could be either a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*.
- When this happens, the player receiving the clue must **consider both possibilities** and hold on to the card until they know for sure.
- Specifically, this means that they will write a *card note* that includes all of the possibilities for a *Play Clue* and all of the possibilities for a *Save Clue*.

<br />

### Three Types of Save Clues

- Corresponding to the list above, there are three types of *Save Clues*:
  - *5 Saves*
  - *2 Saves*
  - *Critical Saves*
- Let's go through each individually.
