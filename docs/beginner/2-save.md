- Even though there are two copies of each 2, we agree that 2's are so important that we need to save them in a manner similar to 5's.
- We agree that 2's should be saved with **a number 2 clue**. This is called a *2 Save*.
- In the example below:
  - Alice clues Bob number 2, which touches a 2 on slot 5.
  - Before this clue, Bob did not have any clued cards in his hand.
  - Since the clue was focused on his chop, Bob knows that this must be a *2 Save* on the 2. It can be any 2 in the game.

- Similar to 5's, 2's **must be saved with a number clue** instead of a color clue. (Otherwise, it will look like a *Play Clue*!)

### When Multiple Copies are Visible

- You can think of the *2 Save* as a last resort to save a 2. Thus, players are not allowed to perform a *2 Save* on a 2 if that same 2 is visible in someone else's hand.
- This is because the team does not actually need to save that 2 quite yet - they can *2 Save* the other copy later on.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Bob has a red 2 on slot 5 (his chop).
  - Cathy has a red 2 on slot 3.
  - Thus, it would be illegal for Alice to perform a *2 Save* on Bob's red 2.
