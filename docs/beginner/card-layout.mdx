## Play Stacks & Player Hands

- The five **play stacks** are on the left.
- The **player hands** are on the right.
- Alice is always player 1. (She will always go first.)
- Bob is always player 2. (He will always go second.)
- Cards are drawn and added to the left side to each hand.
  - Thus, Alice's newest card is the blue 1 and Bob's newest card is the red 1.
- Conversely, the oldest card is the right-most card.
  - Thus, Alice's oldest card is the blue 5 and Bob's oldest card is the red 5.
- A card's _slot_ refers to its position in the hand, from left to right.
  - Thus, the blue 1 is on slot 1, the blue 2 is on slot 2, etc.
