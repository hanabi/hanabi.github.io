- So far, we have covered:
  - how to discard (i.e. the chop)
  - how to tell what a clue means (i.e. a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*)
  - how to tell what the focus of a clue is (i.e. *Chop-Focus* or left-most)
- But that doesn't really tell you much about the *strategy* involved to play Hanabi. How do players find the best move for a certain situation?
- Hanabi is very complicated, so it is impossible to write a guide on how to find the best move. (And that's a good thing, because the game continues to be interesting to play, even after thousands of games!)
- Luckily, beginners can focus on internalizing just **three main principles**:
  1. *Good Touch Principle*
  1. *Save Principle*
  1. *Minimum Clue Value Principle*
- Let's go through each principle individually.
