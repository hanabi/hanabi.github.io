- Enumerate the 5 legal clues that Alice can give right now, along with their clue names.
- What is the best clue?

<TabItem value="solution">

1. Alice can clue blue to Bob, touching the blue 1 as a _Play Clue_.
1. Alice can clue number 1 to Bob, touching the blue 1 as a _Play Clue_.
1. Alice can clue yellow to Cathy, touching the yellow 2 as a _Play Clue_.
1. Alice can clue blue to Cathy, touching the blue 2 as a _Finesse_ on the blue 1.
1. Alice can clue number 2 to Cathy, touching the yellow 2 and the blue 2 as a _2 Save_.

The best clue is the _Finesse_ because it gets two cards played right now. (The team can give a _Play Clue_ to the yellow 2 later on.)
