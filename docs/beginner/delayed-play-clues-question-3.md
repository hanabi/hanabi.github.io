- Alice clues number 4 to Bob, which touches one card on slot 1. (This is a *Play Clue*.)
- Bob writes a *card note* with the identity of the card.

1. What *card note* does Bob write? (Be specific.)
1. Is this a *Delayed Play Clue*?
1. What action should Bob perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

1. Bob writes a *card note* of "red 4, yellow 4, blue 4, purple 4".
    - First, it could be a direct *Play Clue* on a red 4 or a purple 4.
    - Second, it could be a *Delayed Play Clue* on a yellow 4 through Cathy's yellow 2 and yellow 3.
    - Third, it could be a *Delayed Play Clue* on a blue 4 through Donald's blue 3.
1. Bob does not know whether this is a *Play Clue* or a *Delayed Play Clue*. However, since Bob has to treat all *Play Clues* as potential *Delayed Play Clues*, Bob cannot play the 4 on this turn.
1. Since Bob cannot play the 4 yet, he should discard.
