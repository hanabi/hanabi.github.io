- Alice clues red to Bob, touching a card on slot 5.
- Is this a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_?
- What _card note_ does Bob write? (Be specific.)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Bob knows that this could be a _Play Clue_ on the red 1.
- However, since it touched his chop, it could also be a _Save Clue_. Since red 2 is in the trash and a red clue matches that card, it could be red 2.
- Bob does not know whether or not this is a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_, but he has to treat it as a _Save Clue_ for the time being until he gets more information.
- Bob writes a _card note_ that includes the following identities:
  - red 1 (as a _Play Clue_)
  - red 2 (as a _Critical Save_)
- Note that most of the time, players save two's with a _2 Save_. However, if the first copy of a 2 gets discarded, the second copy of that 2 can be _Critical Saved_ in the exact same way that a 3 or a 4 would be.
