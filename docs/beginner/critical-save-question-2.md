- Cathy has three critical cards in a row.
- What action should Alice perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice might be tempted to clue purple to Cathy, which would "get" all three purple cards in one fell swoop.
- However, it would be illegal for Alice to do that because 5's must be saved with a *5 Save*.
- Thus, Alice should clue number 5 to Cathy as a *5 Save*.
- Next, Bob would clue purple to Cathy as a *Critical Save* on the purple 3.
- Cathy would write a *card note* on her slot 4 card that contains the following identities:
  - purple 1 (as a *Play Clue*)
  - purple 3 (as a *Critical Save*)
  - purple 4 (as a *Critical Save*)
