- Fundamentally, Hanabi is all about giving clues. Different groups have different definitions of what clues should mean.
- In our group, clues **always** have a specific meaning.
- Players are **only** allowed to give **two types of clues**:
  - a *Play Clue* (meaning to play the focused card)
  - a *Save Clue* (meaning to save the focused card for later)
- If players cannot give a valid *Play Clue* or a valid *Save Clue*, then they **must discard**.
- Let's go through *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* individually.
