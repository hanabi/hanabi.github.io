### No Nonsense Clues

- Usually, players only discard when they have nothing else to do. But don't take this the wrong way.
- Players are **not allowed** to just clue any card:
  - Players are only allowed to give *Play Clues* to actual playable cards.
  - Players are only allowed to give *Save Clues* to the specific cards outlined in the *Save Principle* section.
- If players cannot give a legal *Play Clue* or *Save Clue*, then they **must discard**.

### Tempo Clues

- Furthermore, players might be tempted to **clue a card again that already has a clue on it** in order to make it play right now. We call this kind of clue a *Tempo Clue*.
- A *Tempo Clue* is defined as a *Play Clue* that does not "get" any brand new cards.
- *Tempo Clues* are quite inefficient - the team is using two clues to get one card. Since *Tempo Clues* are so bad, we say that players are **only allowed to perform *Tempo Clues* in special situations**, like when a player is forced to give a clue.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice is in a special situation where she cannot discard.
  - Bob has a 2 in his hand that was saved with a *2 Save* clue earlier on in the game. He does not know what color it is, but assumes that it is either a red 2 or a blue 2.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, "filling in" the red 2. This is a *Tempo Clue* because there are no new cards. (Since this is so inefficient, Alice would never do this unless she was in a special stalling situation.)
  - Bob can now play the red 2.

### Minimum Clue Value Principle (MCVP)

- So, if a player only has the option to give a *Tempo Clue* or to discard, then they **must discard**.
- We formally express this concept as *Minimum Clue Value Principle*: **all clues must get at least one previously unclued card played or saved**.
- In other words, as a group, we hold ourselves to a high standard, and we don't give inefficient clues.
