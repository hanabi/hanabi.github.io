- Earlier, we explained that the team must save certain types of cards with _Save Clues_.
- But above and beyond this, we also agree that we must "get" all of the playable cards. In order words, **we don't let each other discard playable cards!**
- So, the **full list** of what we must **not discard** is the following:
  - All 5's
  - Unique 2's (i.e. 2's that are the only copy currently visible)
  - Critical cards (i.e. cards that have all other copies discarded)
  - Unique playable cards (i.e. playable cards that are the only copy currently visible)
- Not letting each other discard important cards is called _Save Principle_ and **it is the most important principle of them all**. You are allowed to **break any other principle or rule** in order to prevent a card in this list from being discarded. In fact, sometimes you will have to violate _Good Touch Principle_ in order to save a specific card, and that is okay.

### Violating Good Touch Principle

- In the example below:
  - Alice needs to save the final blue 3 on Bob's chop.
  - Alice knows that she is allowed to perform _Critical Saves_ with either a color clue or a number clue.
  - If Alice clues blue, it will violate _Good Touch Principle_ because it will also touch both copies of blue 4.
  - If Alice clues number 3, it will violate _Good Touch Principle_ because it will touch the red 3 (and the red 3 is already played on the stacks).
  - Here, Alice knows that it is better to violate _Good Touch Principle_ than to lose the chance at a perfect score. Thus, Alice must choose between the lesser of two evils and decide between cluing blue and cluing number 3.
  - Alice decides to clue blue to Bob instead of number 3 because at least one of the blue 4's will be useful later on.
