- In Hanabi, players discard cards from their hand to generate clues for the team. But which card should they discard?
- The right-most **unclued card** in a player's hand is called their "chop" card.
  - This is a metaphor of a card being "on the chopping block".
- When a player needs to discard, they should discard their chop card. This way, **everyone discards in a predictable way**.

## Without Clues

- In the example below:
  - Alice's chop card is the red 5 (on slot 5).
  - Bob's chop card is the red 3 (on slot 5).

## With Clues

- In the example below:
  - Alice's chop card is the blue 4 (on slot 4), because slot 5 is already clued.
  - Bob's chop card is the blue 3 (on slot 2), because slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 are already clued.
