- So far, we have learned about the two types of clues: _Play Clues_ and _Save Clues_.
- But all of the _Play Clues_ and _Save Clues_ that we have seen so far have only "touched" a single card.
- Obviously, it is also possible to give a clue that touches **two or more** cards.
- We agree that if a clue touches two or more cards, the clue only delivers a message about **one specific card**. This is referred to as the _focus_ of the clue.
- With every clue, only **one card is focused**. Nothing specific is implied about non-focused cards (except that they will be useful at some point later on).
- For example, if Alice gives a _Play Clue_ to Bob that touches two cards, then Bob can **only play the focused card**. He has to hold on to the non-focused card for later.

### New Cards

- When determining the _focus_ of a clue, you need to look for "new" cards.
- New cards are specifically defined as **cards that are touched by a clue that did not have any clues "on" them already**.

<br />

### Determining the Focus: 4 Steps

So, when two or more cards are touched by a clue, which card is focused?

1. If no cards are new, then **the focus is on the left-most re-touched card**.
1. If only one card is new, then **the focus is on the new card**.
1. If two or more cards are new, and one of them was on chop, then **the focus is on the chop**.
1. If two or more cards are new, and none of them were on chop, then **the focus is on the left-most new card**.

<br />

### Example 1: Left-Most Focus

- In the example below, Alice clues red to Bob. This must be a _Play Clue_.
- Before this clue, Bob's hand was completely unclued. So, with this clue, **two new cards were introduced** - the red card on slot 2 and the red card on slot 4.
- Bob knows that in this situation, the focus of the clue is the left-most of the two new cards. This must be a _Play Clue_ on a red 1.

### Example 2: Chop-Focus

- In the example below, Alice clues red to Bob. This must be a _Play Clue_.
- Before this clue, Bob's hand was completely unclued. So, with this clue, **three new cards were introduced** - slot 1, slot 2, and slot 5.
- Before this clue, Bob's chop was slot 5. So, since the clue touched his chop and _Chop-Focus_ has precedence, this must be a _Chop-Focus Play Clue_ on a red 1.

- Note that even though it touches Bob's chop card, Bob knows that this cannot be a _Save Clue_. Specifically:
  - It can't be a _5 Save_ on a red 5, because Alice would have clued number 5 for that.
  - It can't be a _2 Save_ on a red 2, because Alice would have clued number 2 for that.
  - It can't be a _Critical Save_, because there are no red cards in the trash yet.
