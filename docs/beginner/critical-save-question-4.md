- Alice clues red to Bob, touching a card on slot 5.
- Is this a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*?
- What *card note* does Bob write? (Be specific.)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Bob knows that this could be a *Play Clue* on the red 1.
- However, since it touched his chop, it could also be a *Save Clue*. Since red 2 is in the trash and a red clue matches that card, it could be red 2.
- Bob does not know whether or not this is a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*, but he has to treat it as a *Save Clue* for the time being until he gets move information.
- Bob writes a *card note* that includes the following identities:
  - red 1 (as a *Play Clue*)
  - red 2 (as a *Critical Save*)
- Note that most of the time, players save two's with a *2 Save*. However, if the first copy of a 2 gets discarded, the second copy of that 2 can be *Critical Saved* in the exact same way that a 3 or a 4 would be.
