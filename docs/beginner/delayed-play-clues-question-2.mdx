- Previously, Cathy was clued about some 1's, and will go on to play both of them.
- Alice clues number 3 to Bob, which touches one card on slot 1. (This is a _Play Clue_.)
- Bob writes a _card note_ with the identity of the card.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write? (Be specific.)
1. Is this a _Delayed Play Clue_?
1. What action should Bob perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

1. Bob writes a _card note_ of "blue 3, purple 3".
1. No, this is not a _Delayed Play Clue_. Bob's 3 cannot connect to Cathy's red 1 or green 1 because no-one else has any connecting 2's.
1. Bob should probably play the 3 immediately (unless he has a good clue to give).
