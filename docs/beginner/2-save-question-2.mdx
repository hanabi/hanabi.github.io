- Previously in the game, Bob was given a _Play Clue_ on a 1. He had planned on playing it on his next turn.
- Now, Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 5.
- From Bob's perspective, is this a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_?
- What _card note_ does Bob write? (Be specific.)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Bob already has a _card note_ of "red 1, a blue 1, purple 1" on his 1 (because these are the 1's left to play on the stacks).
- If this is a _Play Clue_, then the identity of his 2 would be:
  - a yellow 2 (directly playable)
  - or a _Delayed Play Clue_ on the 2 that matches his unknown 1 (e.g. red 2, blue 2, or purple 2)
- However, since Alice's clue touched Bob's chop, it could also be a _Save Clue_. If it is a _Save Clue_, then it could be a _2 Save_ on an unplayable 2.
- Bob does not know whether or not this is a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_, but he has to treat it as a _Save Clue_ for the time being until he gets more information.
- Thus, Bob writes a _card note_ of "red 2, yellow 2, blue 2, purple 2".
  - (It cannot be a green 2 because that card is already played and is useless to the team; Alice would not waste a clue on a useless card like that.)
