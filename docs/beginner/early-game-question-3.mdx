- It is currently the _Early Game_. There is 1 clue token left.
- What action should Alice perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- The **only** legal action that Alice can perform is to clue purple to Cathy as a _Play Clue_ on the purple 2.
  - Alice cannot clue number 2 to Cathy, since that would touch red 2 and would violate _Good Touch Principle_.
