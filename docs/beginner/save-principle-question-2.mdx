- What action should Alice perform?
- If Alice should give a clue, what _card note_ will be written on the focused card? (Be specific.)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice needs to give a _Save Clue_ to Bob's yellow 2 before it is discarded (because everyone agrees that all unique 2's **must** be saved).
- Alice is not allowed to clue yellow, because 2's must be saved with a _2 Save_.
  - If Alice did clue yellow, then it would look like a _Play Clue_ on a yellow card and Bob would try to play it as the yellow 1.
- If Alice clues number 2, then it would be a _2 Save_ on the yellow 2, but it would also duplicate the red 2 (which is already played on the stacks).
- Thus, Alice should clue number 2 to Bob as a _2 Save_ (because it is more important to save cards than it is to satisfy _Good Touch Principle_).
- That clue would be focused on slot 5. Bob will write a _card note_ with the following identities:
  - green 2, blue 2 (as a _Play Clue_)
  - yellow 2, purple 2 (as a _2 Save_)
