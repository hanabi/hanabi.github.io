- Alice is in a special situation where she cannot discard.
- Bob's blue 4 has been previous touched with a blue clue.
- Cathy's red 2 and yellow 2 have previously been touched with a number 2 clue.
- Enumerate all of the legal _Tempo Clues_ that Alice can give.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice could give a _Tempo Clue_ to the blue 4 in Bob's hand:
  - A number 4 clue would be legal, since it would only touch slot 4. This would "fill-in" the 4 to be a blue 4.
  - A blue clue would be legal, since it would only touch slot 4. This would not "fill-in" the card, but the clue would still mean to "play the card", so it would still work properly.
- Alice could give a _Tempo Clue_ to the red 2 in Cathy's hand:
  - A number 2 clue would not be legal, since it would focus slot 1 instead of slot 4.
  - A red clue would be legal, since it would only touch slot 4.
- Alice cannot give a _Tempo Clue_ to the yellow 2 in Cathy's hand:
  - A number 2 clue would not be legal, since it would focus slot 1 instead of slot 5.
  - A yellow clue would not be legal, since it would focus slot 3 instead of slot 5.
