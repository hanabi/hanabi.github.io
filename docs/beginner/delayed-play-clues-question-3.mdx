- Alice clues number 4 to Bob, which touches one card on slot 1. (This is a _Play Clue_.)
- Bob writes a _card note_ with the identity of the card.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write? (Be specific.)
1. Is this a _Delayed Play Clue_?
1. What action should Bob perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

1. Bob writes a _card note_ of "red 4, yellow 4, blue 4, purple 4".
   - First, it could be a direct _Play Clue_ on a red 4 or a purple 4.
   - Second, it could be a _Delayed Play Clue_ on a yellow 4 through Cathy's yellow 2 and yellow 3.
   - Third, it could be a _Delayed Play Clue_ on a blue 4 through Donald's blue 3.
1. Bob does not know whether this is a _Play Clue_ or a _Delayed Play Clue_. However, since Bob has to treat all _Play Clues_ as potential _Delayed Play Clues_, Bob cannot play the 4 on this turn.
1. Since Bob cannot play the 4 yet, he should give an unrelated clue or discard.
