- The purple 1 is played on the stacks.
- Alice can see that
  - Bob has a red 1 on his _Finesse Position_.
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: `red 2, yellow 4, green 1, blue 3`
  - Cathy's green 1 was clued earlier with a green clue and is globally known as green 1.
  - Donald's hand is, from newest to oldest: `red 2, purple 4, green 4, blue 2`
- Which clues are available to Alice?
- Which clue is the best to give?

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice has the following clues available:
  - She can _2 Save_ the blue 2. This would be a 2-for-1, but does not get any cards to play.
  - She can give a _Play Clue_ to the red 1 (with either red or 1). This would be a 1-for-1.
  - She can give a _Finesse_ clue to either red 2. This is a 2-for-1, and preferable to the other options.
- But she is in a tricky situation, because both red 2's are on finesse positions, so if she gives a red clue, both Cathy and Donald will mark their red card as possibly the red 3, leading to an [_Ambiguous_](../level-5.mdx#the-ambiguous-finesse) situation, where the blue 2 might discard from the confusion.
- Since Cathy already has a card to play, and Donald has an important card on chop, the best clue for Alice is to make Donald play the red 2.
- Since all players know about the [_Urgency Principle_](../level-5.mdx#urgency-principle-playing-into-finesses-as-soon-as-possible), it is safe to clue red to Donald, and this is her best option.
- This is a finesse on Bob, so Bob plays his red 1, and Donald will mark his 2 as the red 2 or the red 3.
- Cathy doesn't known about her red 2, so she plays the green 1.
- Donald knows that Cathy must follow the _Urgency Principle_ and should play the red 2 if his red card wasn't playable.
- Donald therefore plays his red card, it successfully plays as the red 2.
