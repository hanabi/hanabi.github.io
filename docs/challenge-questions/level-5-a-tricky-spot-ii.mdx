- The purple 1 is played on the stacks.
- Alice can see that:
  - Bob has a red 1 on his _Finesse Position_.
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: `red 2, yellow 4, green 1, blue 3`
  - Cathy's green 1 was clued earlier with a green clue and is globally known as green 1.
  - Donald's hand is, from newest to oldest: `red 2, purple 4, green 4, blue 2`
- Which clues are available to Alice?
- Which clue is the best to give?
- From the perspective of the player receiving the best clue, what is the note that they would write? (Be specific and include the full evolution of the note.)

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice has the following clues available:
  - She can _2 Save_ the blue 2. This would be a 2-for-1, but does not get any cards to play.
  - She can give a _Play Clue_ to Bob's red 1 (with either red or 1). This would be a 1-for-1.
  - She can give a _Play Clue_ to Cathy's red 2 (with either red or 1). This would cause a _Finesse_ and be a 2-for-1.
  - She can give a _Play Clue_ to Donald's red 2 with red. This would cause a _Finesse_ and be a 2-for-1.
- However, since both red 2's are on _Finesse Position_, if Alice initiates a _Finesse_ with a red clue, both Cathy and Donald will mark their red card as possibly the red 3, leading to an [_Ambiguous Finesse_](../level-5.mdx#the-ambiguous-finesse).
- Since Cathy already has a card to play and Donald has an important card on chop, the best move for Alice is to perform the _Finesse_ on Donald's red 2. This is safe because of [_Urgency Principle_](../level-5.mdx#urgency-principle-playing-into-finesses-as-soon-as-possible):
  - Immediately after Alice's clue, Donald writes a note of "r1, r2 if r1 f, r3 if r2 f" on his red card.
  - Bob knows that he is promised a red 1, so he successfully blind-plays the red 1 from _Finesse Position_.
  - Donald updates his note from "r1, r2 if r1 f, r3 if r2 f" to "r2, r3 if r2 f".
  - Cathy plays her green 1.
  - Donald updates his note from "r2, r3 if r2 f" to "r2".
