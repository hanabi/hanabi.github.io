- It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
- Alice clues 5 to Cathy, touching a 5 on slot 4.
- What kind of clue is this?
- What notes should be written?

- Usually, any clue that is not focused on chop is a _Play Clue_. However, 5 clues are different.
- Level 4 introduces the [5's Chop Move](../level-4#the-5s-chop-move-5cm) which says that a 5 clue to **one-away-from-chop** might have a special meaning.
- However, _5 Stalls_ takes precedence over _5 Chop Moves_, so players need to check the game state.
- Since it is still the _Early Game_, _5 Stalls_ are allowed, and this is not a _Chop Move_.
- No notes should be written. Alice simply didn't see anything else to clue.
