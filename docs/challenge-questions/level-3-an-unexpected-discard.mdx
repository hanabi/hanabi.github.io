- Red 2 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
- Alice has a globally known blue 3 in her hand.
- Bob and Cathy each has two clued 3 in their hands.
- On her turn, Alice discards the blue 3.
- Why did Alice discard the card instead of play it?
- What notes should Bob, Cathy and Donald write? Be specific.

<Question />

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice has realized that her blue 3 has been duplicated. It is her responsibility to _Sarcastic Discard_ the card.
- This means that someone else has this card clued in their hand.
- There is only one other copy of the blue 3. All players will therefore know exactly which player has the card.
- Cathy does not see the blue 3 anywhere, so she writes `b3?` on both her cards (it is not promised to be in any particular slot).
- Bob and Donald can see the blue 3 in Cathy's hand. They should also write `b3?` on Cathy's 3's.
