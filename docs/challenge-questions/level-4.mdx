- It is the _Early Game_.
- Red 1 and blue 5 are played on the stacks.
- Previously, Bob played blue 3 from slot 2 and blue 4 from slot 4.
- Cathy has two unknown 2's saved on chop.
- Alice clues 1 to Bob which touches the cards in slot 2 and 3.
- Bob plays his slot 3 card and initiates the green stack.
- What actions will Cathy take on her turn?

- As Bob played two cards from slots 2 and 4 respectively, his starting hand slot 1 card slid over by two positions.
- As a result, his slot 3 card was initially in his starting hand, while his slot 2 card must have been drawn after Bob played blue 3.
- Thus, his slot 2 card is a "fresh" 1, whereas his slot 3 card is a 1 from the starting hand.

- Everyone agrees that unknown 1's are supposed to be played in a particular order.
- Even though Bob played his rightmost unknown 1 first, this is not the expected play order as "fresh" 1's take precedence.
- Therefore, he must have meant to send a signal.
- Cathy recognizes that Bob performed an _Order Chop Move_.
- Thus Cathy should _Chop Move_ her slot 3 card.
- Cathy writes "cm" on her slot 3 card and proceeds to give a clue or discard her slot 2 card.
