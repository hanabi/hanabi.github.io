These questions are for [level 4](../level-4.mdx) strategies.

## Question 1

<Tabs

  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question1'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution1'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question1">

- It is the _Early Game_.
- Red 1 and blue 5 are played on the stacks.
- Previously, Bob played blue 3 from slot 2 and blue 4 from slot 4.
- Cathy has two unknown 2's saved on chop.
- Alice clues number 1 to Bob which touches the cards in slot 2 and 3.
- Bob plays his slot 3 card. It is a green 1 and successfully plays.
- What slot will Cathy discard next?

<Question1 />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution1">

- Since Bob previously played a card from slot 2 and 4, he has drawn two cards.
- As a result, his slot 3 card must have been in his starting hand, while his slot 2 card must have been drawn after playing the blue 3.
- Thus, his slot 2 card is a "fresh" one and his slot 3 card is a "normal" one from the starting hand.

<Solution1Part1 />

- As established in level 3, [unknown 1's are supposed to be played in a particular order](../level-3.mdx#playing-multiple-1s). Specifically, [fresh 1's are supposed to have precedence](../level-3.mdx#part-2---the-fresh-1s-rule).
- This means that Bob was expected to play his slot 2 card instead of his slot 3 card.
- Thus, Cathy knows that Bob intended for an _Order Chop Move_. Cathy _Chop Moves_ her slot 3 card. Her new chop is slot 2, so that would be the slot that Cathy would discard next.

## Question 2

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question2"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question2'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution2'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question2">

- It is the first turn of the game.
- Alice clues number 1 to Bob.
- The order of playing these 1s is from right to left.

<Question2Part1 />

- Bob plays the rightmost 1 (drawing a new card in the process). It successfully plays as red 1.
- Cathy does something unrelated.
- Alice clues Bob red on the chop card, giving him red 2.

<Question2Part2 />

- Bob plays his slot 5 1, the 1 next in order (drawing another card). It successfully plays as b1.
- Cathy does something unrelated.
- Alice gives Bob a number 1 clue again, touching Bob's two new cards as well as re-touching the 1s from his starting hand.
- Which card does Bob play to avoid chop-moving trash on either player's chop?

<Question2Part3 />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution2">

- In rare scenarios, another number 1 clue may be given before the previously clued 1s have played, to touch fresher 1s drawn by the player.
- When this happens, the play-order notes on previous 1s are erased and the order of playing the 1s is re-calculated. The precedence remains the same: Chop, then Fresh 1s leftmost first, then Starting Hand 1s rightmost first.
  - Bob is surprised to receive two more 1s. He erases his notes on his previous 1s.
  - Slot 2 1 is chop, so Bob writes '1st' on it. Slot 1 card is a fresh 1, he writes '2nd' on it. Slot 4 and 5 cards are 1s from his starting hand. He writes '3rd' on slot 5 and '4th' on slot 4.
  - Bob also knows that the 1 on slot 4 will never play, so he marks it as known-trash.
  - Bob plays his slot 2 1. It successfully plays as y1 and does not chop-move any player.
