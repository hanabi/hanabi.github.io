<TabItem value="question1">

- It is the _Early Game_.
- Red 1 and blue 5 are played on the stacks.
- Previously, Bob played blue 3 from slot 2 and blue 4 from slot 4.
- Cathy has two unknown 2's saved on chop.
- Alice clues number 1 to Bob which touches the cards in slot 2 and 3.
- Bob plays his slot 3 card. It is a green 1 and successfully plays.
- What slot will Cathy discard next?

- Since Bob previously played a card from slot 2 and 4, he has drawn two cards.
- As a result, his slot 3 card must have been in his starting hand, while his slot 2 card must have been drawn after playing the blue 3.
- Thus, his slot 2 card is a "fresh" one and his slot 3 card is a "normal" one from the starting hand.

- As established in level 3, [unknown 1's are supposed to be played in a particular order](../level-3.mdx#playing-multiple-1s). Specifically, [fresh 1's are supposed to have precedence](../level-3.mdx#part-2---the-fresh-1s-rule).
- This means that Bob was expected to play his slot 2 card instead of his slot 3 card.
- Thus, Cathy knows that Bob intended for an _Order Chop Move_. Cathy _Chop Moves_ her slot 3 card. Her new chop is slot 2, so that would be the slot that Cathy would discard next.
