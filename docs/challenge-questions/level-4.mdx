- It is still _Early Game_. and the red 1 is played on the stacks while the blue stack has been completed.
- Alice played the blue 3 card from slot 2 and the blue 4 card from slot 4 thus far.
- Bob has two unknown 2's saved on chop.
- Cathy clues 1 to Alice which touches the cards in slot 2 and 3.
- Alice plays her slot 3 card and initiates the green stack.
- What actions will Bob take on his turn?

<TabItem value="solution1">

- As Alice played two cards from slots 2 and 4 respectively, her starting hand slot 1 card slid over by two positions.
- As a result, her slot 3 card was initially in her starting hand, while her slot 2 card must have been drawn after Alice played blue 3.
- Thus, her slot 2 card is a "fresh" 1, whereas her slot 3 card is a 1 from the starting hand.

- Everyone agrees that unknown 1's are supposed to be played in a particular order.
- Even though Alice played her rightmost unknown 1 first, this is not the expected play order as "fresh" 1's take precedence.
- Therefore, she must have meant to send a signal.
- Bob recognizes that Alice performed an _Order Chop Move_.
- Thus Bob should _Chop Move_ his slot 3 card.
- Bob writes "cm" on his slot 3 card and proceeds to give a clue or discard his slot 2 card.
