- All the 2's are played on the stacks.
- There are 0 clues available.
- Alice has a known playable red 3.
- Bob has a green 4 on chop (green 3 has not been played yet).
- Alice wants to save the useful green 4 and discards instead of playing the red 3.
- Is this a legal [_Scream Discard_](../level-7.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)? Why or why not?

<Question />

<TabItem value="solution">

- This is **not** a legal [_Scream Discard_](../level-7.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm) because the green 4 is _one-away-from-playable_.
- Players are **only** allowed to _Scream Discard_ for cards that are **playable** or **critical**, not for cards that are _one-away-from-playable_.
