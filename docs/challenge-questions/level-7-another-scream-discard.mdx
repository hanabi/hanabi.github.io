- All the 2's have been played on the stacks.
- There are 0 clues available.
- Alice has a known playable red 3.
- Bob has a green 4 on chop (green 3 has not been played yet).
- Alice wants to save the useful green 3 and discards instead of playing the red 2.
- Is this a legal [_Scream Discard_](../level-7.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)? Why or why not?

<TabItem value="solution">

- This is **not** a legal [_Scream Discard_](../level-7.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm).
- Since the green 4 requires the green 3 to be played or clued first, it is _one-away-from-playable_.
- Players are **only** allowed to _Scream Discard_ for cards that are **playable or critical**, not for cards that are merely _one-away-from-playable_.
- If Alice performs this action:
  - Bob doesn't know the identity of his card, and would mark is card as _Chop Moved_, thinking it is critical or playable.
  - Cathy should treat it as a known mistake, but must remember that Bob has _Chop Moved_.
