- Bob has two clued, but otherwise unknown cards in his hand: a blue card in slot 3 and a green card in slot 4.
- Alice clues number 3 to Bob which touches the two clued cards and "fills them in" to be exactly blue and green 3.
- One blue 4 is in the discard pile. The other blue 4 is yet to be drawn from the remaining available cards.
- What is the meaning of the clue?
- What is the focus of the clue?

<TabItem value="solution">

- Since Bob's cards were already "gotten" when Alice clued, this must be a [_Tempo Clue_](../level-6.mdx#the-tempo-clue).
- The clue gets exactly two new cards to become playable within the next turn.
- As the last remaining blue 4 is not accounted for, it is not currently possible for a [_Prompt_](../level-2.mdx#the-prompt) to get the blue card played at this time.
- As a result, even though it does not meet the [_Minimum Clue Value Principle_](../beginner/minimum-clue-value-principle) it is still considered to be "valuable".
- As a _Tempo Clue_, the focus of the clue is the leftmost, blue 3 card.
