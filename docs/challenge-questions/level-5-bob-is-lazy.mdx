- It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
- Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching Cathy's slot 1 and slot 4. (This is a _Play Clue_ on Cathy's slot 1 card.)
- Bob has a red 1 on his _Finesse Position_, so Cathy knows that Bob might blind-play it, which would make Alice's clue a _Finesse_ on red 1 into red 2.
- Instead, Bob clues number 1 to Alice, touching a green 1 on slot 1.
- What should Cathy do?

<TabItem value="solution">

- Bob seemingly defers blind-playing and instead gives a 1-for-1 clue to a card that just as easily could have been gotten by Cathy.
- The [_Urgency Principle_](../level-5.mdx#urgency-principle-playing-into-finesses-as-soon-as-possible) says that blind-plays should happen **as soon as possible**. Thus, _Urgency Principle_ means that Bob was never _Finessed_ in the first place.
- However, Alice's clue must be a _Finesse_ of some kind, because Cathy's slot 1 card was indicated as being playable. Thus, it would be classified as an [_Ambiguous_](../level-5.mdx#the-ambiguous-finesse) [_Self-Finesse_](../level-2.mdx#the-self-finesse) on Cathy, which means that Cathy should blind-play her _Finesse Position_ as any playable 1.
- Once Cathy successfully blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ as a yellow 1, she knows that her previously unknown 2 that was the _Finesse_ target must match and must be exactly yellow 2.
