- It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
- Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching Cathy's slot 1 and slot 4. (This is a _Play_ clue on Cathy's slot 1 card.)
- Bob has a red 1 on his _Finesse Position_, so Cathy knows that Bob might blind-play it, which would make Alice's clue a _Finesse_ on red 1 into red 2.
- Instead, Bob clues number 1 to Alice, touching a green 1 on slot 1.
- What should Cathy do?

<TabItem value="solution">

- The [_Urgency Principle_](../level-5.mdx#urgency-principle-playing-into-finesses-as-soon-as-possible) says that blind-plays should happen **as soon as possible**.
- Bob seemingly defers blind-playing and instead gives a 1-for-1 clue to a card which is not on chop.
- Bob is **not** lazy, he found Alice's clue to be perfectly fine, and didn't see any reason to blind-play.
- The _Finesse_ is therefore an [_Ambiguous_](../level-5.mdx#the-ambiguous-finesse) [_Self-Finesse_](../level-2.mdx#the-self-finesse) on Cathy, which should play her slot 2 as any playable 1.
- Her slot 2 plays successfully as the yellow 1, and she marks her (new) slot 2 card as the matching yellow 2.
