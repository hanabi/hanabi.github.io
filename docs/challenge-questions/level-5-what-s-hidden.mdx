- The red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
- Bob has:
  - An unclued blue 2 on slot 1.
  - A red 2 on slot 4 clued with a number 2 clue.
- Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching a 3 as a _Play Clue_.
- Bob plays the blue 2.
- Which notes should Cathy write?
- What should she do next?

<TabItem value="solution">

- Cathy's card might be a red 3, in which case this is just a normal [_Prompt_](../level-1.mdx#the-prompt) on the red 2.
- Her card might also be a blue 3, if Alice intended a [_Hidden Finesse_](../level-5.mdx#the-hidden-finesse) on the blue 2.
- Cathy sees that both clues are legal, so she writes `r3, b3 if finesse` on her card.
- Cathy should wait until next round to see whether Bob continues to play his b2 before she can play her 3.
- It is important that **she should not** clue the blue 2, or she might be _Stomping_ on a _Finesse_.
