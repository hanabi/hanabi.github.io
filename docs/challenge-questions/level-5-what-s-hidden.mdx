- The red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
- Bob has:
  - An unclued blue 2 on slot 1.
  - A red 2 on slot 4 clued with a number 2 clue. (Bob does not know the identity.)
- Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching a 3 on slot 3 as a _Play Clue_.
- Bob plays the red 2.
- Which notes should Cathy write on her 3?
- What should Cathy do next?

<TabItem value="solution">

- Cathy's 3 might be a red 3, which would make Alice's clue a [_Prompt_](../level-1.mdx#the-prompt) on the red 2.
- Cathy's 3 might also be a blue 3, which would make Alice's clue a [_Hidden Finesse_](../level-5.mdx#the-hidden-finesse) on the blue 2.
- Since both clues are legal, Cathy writes `r3, b3 if b2 f` on her card.
- Thus, Cathy cannot play her 3 right now, so she must discard or perform some unrelated clue. Notably, Cathy should not clue the blue 2, because that might _Stomp_ on the _Hidden Finesse_.
