- The red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
- Bob has:
  - An unclued blue 2 on slot 1.
  - A clued blue 2 on slot 4 with a number 2 clue.
- Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching a blue 3 on slot 3 as a _Play Clue_.
- Which notes will be written?
- What should Bob and Cathy do next?

<Question />

<TabItem value="solution">

- Cathy's card _might_ be a red 3, in which case this is just a normal [_Prompt_](../level-1.mdx#the-prompt) on the red 2.
- However, Cathy's card is actually a blue 3, and Alice intends a [_Hidden Finesse_](../level-5.mdx#the-hidden-finesse).
- Cathy sees that both clues are legal, so she writes `r3, b3 if finesse` on her card.
- Bob is unaware of the hidden part, and plays his clued 2, expecting it to be the blue 2.

<AnswerPart1 />

- It is _not_ the card he expected it to be, and he may believe that Cathy is going to misplay the blue 3.
- But he trusts Alice, and must assume she has given a _Hidden Finesse_, so he goes back in history to find the _Finesse Position_ when the clue was given, and writes `b2` on that card, which now has moved to slot 2.
- Cathy still doesn't know which card she has, so she must discard (or find something else to clue).
  - It is important that **she should not** clue the blue 2, or she might be _Stomping_ on a _Finesse_.

<AnswerPart2 />

- The next round, Bob blind-plays the blue 2.
- After this move, Cathy is certain that she has the blue 3, and she can play now, or find a good clue to give.
