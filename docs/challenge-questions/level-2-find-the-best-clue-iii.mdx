<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice's most valuable clue is number 4 to Bob. This would be a _Play Clue_ on the red 4 and initiate a [_Self-Finesse_](../level-2.mdx#the-self-finesse).
- Alice can expect that Bob to play into the _Self-Finesse_ because:
  - Bob will know that the number 4 clue cannot be a _Save Clue_. (No 4's are currently critical.)
  - Bob will know that the number 4 clue cannot be a direct _Play Clue_, since there are no immediately playable 4's.
  - Bob will know that the number 4 clue cannot be a [_Reverse Finesse_](../level-2.mdx#the-reverse-finesse), because Cathy does not have any playable cards on her _Finesse Position_ that connect to a 4.
- Alice could also clue number 3 to Bob as a _Play Clue_ on the red 3, but this would only "get" one brand new card instead of two brand new cards.
