- Bob writes a card note with the identity of the card.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write?
1. What action should Bob perform?

<TabItem value="solution">

1. Bob writes "r3, b3, p3 if purple 2 f".
   - Bob knows that this must be a _Play Clue_ on his 3, since it is not on chop. It could be an immediately playable red 3 or blue 3, but it could also be a _Reverse Finesse_ on a purple 3.
1. Bob must entertain the possibility of a _Reverse Finesse_. For now, Bob needs to clue green to Cathy, which would be a _Critical Save_ on the critical green 3.
   - If Cathy blind-plays the purple 2, Bob will update his note to "r3, b3, p3 if purple 2 f | purple 3".
   - If Cathy does not blind-play the purple 2, Bob will update his note to "r3, b3, p3 if purple 2 f | red 3, blue 3".
   - (This cannot be a _Self-Finesse_ on Bob, since he knows that _Self-Finesses_ cannot be given if a _Play Clue_ interpretation is possible. In this case, the clued card could be an immediately playable red 3 or blue 3.)
