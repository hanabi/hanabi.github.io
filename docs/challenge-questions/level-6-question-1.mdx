- Bob has two clued, but otherwise unknown cards in his hand: a blue card in slot 3 and a green card in slot 4.
- Alice clues 3 to Bob which touches the two clued cards in slots 3 and 4.
- One blue 4 is in the discard pile. The other blue 4 is yet to be drawn from the remaining available cards.
- What is the meaning of the clue?
- What is the focus of the clue?

<TabItem value="solution">

- Since Bob's cards were already "gotten" when Alice clued, this must be a _Tempo Clue_.
- The clue gets exactly two new cards to become playable within the next turn.
- As the last remaining blue 4 is not accounted for, it is not currently possible for a _Prompt_ to get the blue card played at this time.
- As a result, even though it does not meet the _[Minimum Clue Value Principle](../beginner/minimum-clue-value-principle)_ it is still considered to be "valuable".
- As a _Tempo Clue_, the focus of the clue is the leftmost, blue 3 card.
