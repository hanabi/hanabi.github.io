## Question 1

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question1"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question1'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution1'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question1">

- Alice has two clued, but otherwise unknown cards in her hand: a blue card in slot 3 and a green card in slot 4.
- Bob clues 3 to Alice which touches the two clued cards in slots 3 and 4.
- One blue 4 is in the discard pile. The other blue 4 is yet to be drawn from the remaining available cards.
- What is the meaning of the clue?
- What is the focus of the clue?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution1">

- Since Alice cards were already "gotten" when Bob clued, this must be a _Tempo Clue_.
- The clue gets exactly two new cards to become playable within the next turn.
- As the last remaining blue 4 is not accounted for, it is not currently possible for a _Prompt_ to get the blue card played at this time.
- As a result, even though it does not meet the _[Minimum Clue Value Principle](../beginner/minimum-clue-value-principle)_ it is still considered to be "valuable".
- As a _Tempo Clue_, the focus of the clue is the leftmost, blue 3 card.

## Question 2

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question2"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question2'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution2'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question2">

- Alice has one clued, but otherwise unknown card in her hand: a green card in slot 4.
- Bob clues 3 to Alice, which touches her card in slot 4 and "fills it in".
- What actions will Alice take on her next turn?

<Question2 />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution2">

- Since Alice card was already "gotten" when Bob clued, this must be a _Tempo Clue_.
- The clue gets a single new card to become playable within the next turn.
- Thus, the clue is not considered to be "valuable" enough; it must have a deeper meaning.
- Alice knows that a non-valuable _Tempo Clue_ actually _Chop Moves_ the card currently on the chop.
- Alice performs the following actions:
  - Alice marks her slot 3 card as being _Chop Moved_ with a "cm" note on the card.
  - Alice will play the green 3 card from slot 4 on her next turn.

## Question 3

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question3"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question3'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution3'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question3">

- The red 1 card is played on the stacks.
- Alice has a red card in slot 3, promised to be a playable red 4.
- Bob has an unknown 5, saved on chop.
- Cathy has a red card in slot 2, promised to a a playable red 3.
- Alice then gives a red clue to Bob, that touches a red card on slot 1 and fills-in the previously unknown red 5 in slot 5.
- What actions will Bob take on his turn?

<Question3 />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution3">

- In this situation, the focus of the red clue is ambiguous:

  - If the red clue were focused on the "new" slot 1 card, then the focus would be _Trash_, so the resulting move would be a _Trash Chop Move_ on slots 2, 3 and 4.
  - If the red clue were focused on the already-clued slot 5, then the focus would be the previously-unknown-to-be-playable red 5, so the resulting move would be a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_ on slot 4.
  - Bob also knows that _Tempo Clue Chop Moves_ have precedence over _Trash Chop Moves_.
  - Thus, in this situation, Bob should only _Chop Move_ the card in slot 4.
  - Bob writes "cm" on his slot 4 card and proceeds to give an unrelated clue or discards his slot 1 card.
