## Question 1

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question1"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question1'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution1'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question1">

- Alice has two clued, but otherwise unknown cards in her hand: a blue card in slot 3 and a green card in slot 4.
- Bob clues 3 to Alice which touches the two clued cards in slots 3 and 4.
- One blue 4 is in the discard pile. The other blue 4 is yet to be drawn from the remaining available cards.
- What is the meaning of the clue?
- What is the focus of the clue?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution1">

- Since Alice cards were already "gotten" when Bob clued, this must be a _Tempo Clue_.
- The clue gets exactly two new cards to become playable within the next turn.
- As the last remaining blue 4 is not accounted for, it is not currently possible for a _Prompt_ to get the blue card played at this time.
- As a result, even though it does not meet the _[Minimum Clue Value Principle](../beginner/minimum-clue-value-principle)_ it is still considered to be "valuable".
- As a _Tempo Clue_, the focus of the clue is the leftmost, blue 3 card.

## Question 2

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question2"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question2'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution2'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question2">

- Alice has one clued, but otherwise unknown card in her hand: a green card in slot 4.
- Bob clues 3 to Alice, which touches her card in slot 4 and "fills it in".
- What actions will Alice take on her next turn?

<Question2 />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution2">

- Since Alice card was already "gotten" when Bob clued, this must be a _Tempo Clue_.
- The clue gets a single new card to become playable within the next turn.
- Thus, the clue is not considered to be "valuable" enough; it must have a deeper meaning.
- Alice knows that a non-valuable _Tempo Clue_ actually _Chop Moves_ the card currently on the chop.
- Alice performs the following actions:
  - Alice marks her slot 3 card as being _Chop Moved_ with a "cm" note on the card.
  - Alice will play the green 3 card from slot 4 on her next turn.
