- The purple 1 is played on the stacks.
- Alice can see that:
  - Bob has a red 1 on his _Finesse Position_,
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: `red 2, yellow 4, green 1, blue 3`
  - Cathy's green 1 was clued earlier with a green clue and is globally known as green 1.
  - Donald's hand is, from newest to oldest: `red 2, purple 4, green 4, blue 5`
- Which clues are available to Alice?
- Which clue is the best to give?

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice has the following clues available:
  - She can _5 Save_ the blue 5. This is safe, but does not get any cards to play.
  - She can give a _Play Clue_ to Bob's red 1 (with either red or 1). This would be a 1-for-1.
  - She can give a _Play Clue_ to Cathy's red 2 (with either red or 1). This would cause a _Finesse_ and would be a 2-for-1.
  - She can give a _Play Clue_ to Donald's red 2 (with either red or 1). This would cause a _Finesse_ and would be a 2-for-1.
- However, since both red 2's are on _Finesse Position_, if Alice initiates a _Finesse_ with a red clue, both Cathy and Donald will mark their red card as possibly the red 3, leading to an [_Ambiguous Finesse_](../level-5.mdx#the-ambiguous-finesse).
- Thus, the correct way to initiate the _Finesse_ is with a number 2 clue, which does not cause any ambiguity.
- Is it better to use Cathy's red 2 or Donald's red 2? Since Cathy already has a green 1 to play and Donald has an important card on chop, the best clue for Alice is to clue number 2 to Donald to trigger a _Finesse_.
