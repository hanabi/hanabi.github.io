- The purple 1 is played on the stacks.
- Cathy has a globally known green 1 in her hand.
- Alice can see that
  - Bob has a red 1 on his finesse position,
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: `red 2, yellow 4, green 1, blue 3`
  - Donald's hand is, from newest to oldest: `red 2, purple 4, green 4, blue 5`
- Which clues are available to Alice?
- Which clue is the best to give?

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice has the following clues available:
  - She can _5 Save_ the blue 5. This is safe, but doesn't get any cards to play.
  - She can give a _Play_ clue to the red 1 (with either red or 1, depending on Bob's other cards). This is a 1-for-1.
  - She can give a _Finesse_ clue to either red 2. This is a 2-for-1, and preferable to the other options.
- But she is in a tricky situation, because both red 2's are on finesse positions, so if she gives a red clue, both Cathy and Donald will mark their red card as possibly the red 3, leading to an [_Ambiguous_](../level-5.mdx#the-ambiguous-finesse) situation, where the blue 5 might discard from the confusion.
- The correct clue is therefore _2_, which eliminates the ambiguity.
- Since Cathy already has a card to play, and Donald has an important card on chop, the best clue for Alice is to clue 2 to Donald.
- This is a finesse on Bob, so Bob plays his red 1, and Donald will mark his 2 as the red 2.
