- Bob has an unknown 5 in his hand.
- Cathy has an unknown yellow card in her hand.
- What is the best clue that Alice can give?

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice's most valuable clue is green to Bob. This would be a _Play Clue_ on the green 4 and initiate a [_Reverse Finesse_](../level-2.mdx#the-reverse-finesse).
- Unlike the previous question, the _Reverse Finesse_ will work because Cathy knows that her yellow card cannot connect to a green 4.
- Alice could also clue number 3 to Cathy as a _Play Clue_ on the green 3. This would also "fill in" the yellow 3. But it would only "get" one brand new card instead of two brand new cards.
