- All the 2's have been played on the stacks.
- There are 0 clues available.
- Alice has a globally known playable blue 3.
- Cathy has a critical purple 5 on her chop.
- Alice decides to discard her chop instead of playing the blue 3.
- Why did Alice discard?
- What notes should Bob write?
- What should Bob do on his turn?

<Question />

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice performed a [_Generation Discard_](../level-7.mdx#the-generation-discard).
- If Alice had played her blue 3, Bob would be forced to discard, and then Cathy might decide to discard the critical purple 5.
- By performing a _Generation Discard_, Alice gives Bob a clue token to spend.
- Since Cathy has a critical or playable card on her chop, Bob should use that clue to _5 Save_ Cathy's purple 5.
- Bob should **not** write any notes, as a _Generation Discard_ does not _Chop Move_ any cards.
