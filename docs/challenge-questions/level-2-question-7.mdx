- Alice clues number 3 to Bob, which touches two cards on slot 3 and slot 5.
- This is a _Chop Focus_ clue, which means that slot 5 is focused.
- Bob writes a card note on both of the cards.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write on each card?
1. What action should Bob perform?

<TabItem value="solution">

1. Bob writes "r3" on the slot 5 card, and "y3, g3, b3, p3" on the slot 3 card.
   - Since Bob got a _Chop Focus_ clue, he should treat it as a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_.
   - However, there are no directly playable 3's, so this cannot be a direct _Play Clue_.
   - The only 3 in the trash is the red 3, so this must be a _Save Clue_ on a red 3.
   - This cannot be a _Self-Finesse_, because Alice would expect Bob to treat the clue as a _Save Clue_ on the red 3.
   - This cannot be a _Reverse Finesse_. Even though Cathy has a red 2 on her _Finesse Position_, Cathy would interpret a clue touching a critical red 3 on chop as a _Save Clue_. Thus, she would never blind-play anything from Alice's clue.
1. Assuming that Alice has no cards of interest, Bob should clue number 2 to Cathy as a _Play Clue_ on the red 2. (A number 2 clue is better than a red clue because it gets the purple 2 "for free".)
