- It is the first turn of the game.
- Alice clues blue to Donald's blue 3 on slot 2.
- This is a _Double Finesse_ on Bob, so Bob plays his slot 1 as the blue 1.
- Then Cathy clues red to Donald, touching a red 2 on slot 3.
- Alice doesn't have any red cards in her hand.
- What notes should Bob write from this clue?
- What should Bob do on his next turn?

- Since Bob cannot see the missing red 1, he must have it.
- He is therefore _Finessed_ again — a _Queued Finesse_.
- He does not know whether the original blue finesse was a _Layered Finesse_ or not.
- He must therefore mark his slot 2 as the red 1 _or_ the blue 2 (or possibly some other playable card).
  - If slot 2 is the blue 2, then Alice's clue was a regular _Double Finesse_, and Cathy's clue was a normal _Finesse_, promising Bob's red 1 on slot 1.
  - If slot 2 is the red 1, then Alice's clue was a _Layered Finesse_, and he should expect the blue 2 to be on slot 3.
  - If slot 2 is another playable 1, then Alice's clue was a (doubly) _Layered Finesse_, and the hunt for the blue 2 and red 1 must continue in the same manner from slot 3.
- In any case, he must play slot 2 first, and after seeing what it is, update his notes accordingly.
