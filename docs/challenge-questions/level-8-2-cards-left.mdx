- There are 2 cards left in the deck, and 2 clues available. No one has any clued cards.
- What action should Alice perform?

<Question />

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice sees the red 3 in Cathy's hand and the red 5 in Bob's hand.
- If Alice has the red 4 in her hand, then the situation is simple: the team will clue the red cards and then play them.
- On the other hand, it is possible that both red 4s are still in the deck. In this case, there would be no time to play the 5 after playing the 4.
- Thus, Alice should discard. She is guaranteed to either have had a red 4 in her hand, or to draw one of the copies.
  - (For the purposes of this example, we assume that it is extremely unlikely for Alice to be discarding the red 4, since the team would have likely _Chop Moved_ it earlier on.)
- After Alice discards, Bob can _Finesse_ the red 3 by cluing Alice's red 4, and then the red 5 can play in the subsequent round.
