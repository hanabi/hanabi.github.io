## Question 1

<Tabs
defaultValue="question1"
values={[
{label: 'Question', value: 'question1'},
{label: 'Solution', value: 'solution1'},
]}>
<TabItem value="question1">

- It is currently the _Early Game_. There is 1 clue token left.
- What action should Alice perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution1">

- The only legal move is for Alice to give a _5 Stall_ to Donald (touching the purple 5).
- There are no other legal _Play Clues_ or _Save Clues_ to give. And because a _5 Stall_ is possible, Alice is not allowed to discard.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 2

<Tabs
defaultValue="question2"
values={[
{label: 'Question', value: 'question2'},
{label: 'Solution', value: 'solution2'},
]}>
<TabItem value="question2">

- Alice clues blue to Bob, which touches one card on slot 2.
- Bob writes a card note with the identity of the card.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write?
1. What action should Bob perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution2">

1. Bob writes "blue 2, blue 3 if blue 2 f".
   - Bob knows that this must be a _Play Clue_ on his blue card, since it is not on chop. Blue 2 has not been played and has not been touched elsewhere, so this card could be the blue 2.
   - However, Bob also sees a blue 2 on Cathy's _Finesse Position_, so Alice could have performed a _Reverse Finesse_. If that is the case, this card could be a blue 3.
1. Bob must entertain the possibility of a _Reverse Finesse_, so he cannot play the blue card immediately. Assuming there is nothing useful to clue in Alice's hand, Bob should just discard (and avoid cluing the blue 2).
   - If Cathy blind-plays her blue 2 on her turn, Bob can update his note to "blue 2, blue 3 if blue 2 f | blue 3".
   - If Cathy has nothing more urgent to do and still does not play her blue 2 on her turn, Bob can update his note with "blue 2, blue 3 if blue 2 f | blue 3".

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question2 />

## Question 3

<Tabs
defaultValue="question3"
values={[
{label: 'Question', value: 'question3'},
{label: 'Solution', value: 'solution3'},
]}>
<TabItem value="question3">

- Alice clues 3 to Bob, which touches one card on slot 4. It has negative red and green on it.
- Bob writes a card note with the identity of the card.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write?
1. What action should Bob perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution3">

1. Bob writes "yellow 3, blue 3, purple 3" (i.e. same as empathy).
   - Bob knows that this must be a _Play Clue_ on his 3, since it is not on chop. It is not currently playable, and it cannot be a finesse off Cathy's green 2, since it is explicitly not a green 3. Therefore this is a _Self-Finesse_ and Bob must have the 2 to make his 3 playable.
   - Bob does not know exactly which 3 is playable until he plays his finesse position.
1. Bob should blind-play slot 1 immediately to demonstrate that he (and not Cathy) has the connecting 2.
   - Cathy's chop is trash and does not need saving.
   - At [higher levels](/docs/level-5#urgency-principle-playing-into-finesses-as-soon-as-possible), Bob can consider deferring blind-playing, but only to give his own finesse on the green 2!
   - After playing the 2, he should mark his 3 with the same color as the 2 that was played.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 4

<Tabs
defaultValue="question4"
values={[
{label: 'Question', value: 'question4'},
{label: 'Solution', value: 'solution4'},
]}>
<TabItem value="question4">

- Alice clues 2 to Bob, which touches one card on slot 5.
- Bob discards trash from slot 4.
- Assuming Alice has trash on chop, should Cathy blind-play? Why or why not?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution4">

- No, Alice should not blind-play. The 2 is on chop, so this is just a regular _2 Save_. Since it is not a _Play Clue_, Cathy is not promised a connecting yellow 1.
- If Alice wanted to give a _Reverse Finesse_ on the yellow 2, she must give yellow on the yellow 2 as a _Play Clue_.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question4 />

## Question 5

<Tabs
defaultValue="question5"
values={[
{label: 'Question', value: 'question5'},
{label: 'Solution', value: 'solution5'},
]}>
<TabItem value="question5">

- Alice clues 3 to Bob, which touches one card on slot 2.
- Bob writes a card note with the identity of the card.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write?
1. What action should Bob perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution5">

1. Bob writes "red 3, blue 3, purple 3 if purple 2 f".
   - Bob knows that this must be a _Play Clue_ on his 3, since it is not on chop. It could be an immediately playable red 3 or blue 3, but it can also be a _Reverse Finesse_ on a purple 3.
1. Bob must entertain the possibility of a _Reverse Finesse_. Assuming there is nothing useful to clue in Alice's hand, Bob should just discard.
   - Bob updates his note to "red 3, blue 3, purple 3 if purple 2 f | purple 3" if Cathy blind-plays. Otherwise he updates it to "red 3, blue 3, purple 3 if purple 2 f | red 3, blue 3".
   - This cannot be a _Self-Finesse_ on Bob, since he knows that _Self-Finesses_ cannot be given if a _Play Clue_ interpretation is possible. In this case, the clued card can be an immediately playable red 3 or blue 3.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question5 />

## Question 6

<Tabs
defaultValue="question6"
values={[
{label: 'Question', value: 'question6'},
{label: 'Solution', value: 'solution6'},
]}>
<TabItem value="question6">

- Alice clues 2 to Bob, which touches one card on slot 5.
- Bob discards trash from slot 4.
- Assuming Alice has trash on chop, should Cathy blind-play? Why or why not?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution6">

- Yes, Cathy should blind-play. Green 4 is not critical, so the 4 clue is not a _Save Clue_ and must be a _Play Clue_. Cathy is promised a green 3 to make the green 4 playable.
- Cathy also trusts that Bob knows his 4 is exactly a green 4. At first, Bob had to treat the 4 clue as a save on the critical purple 4, but if it was truly a purple 4, Cathy would not blind-play.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question6 />

## Question 7

<Tabs
defaultValue="question7"
values={[
{label: 'Question', value: 'question7'},
{label: 'Solution', value: 'solution7'},
]}>
<TabItem value="question7">

- Alice clues 3 to Bob, which touches two cards on slot 3 and 5.
- Bob writes a card note with the identity of the card.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write?
1. What action should Bob perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution7">

1. Bob writes "red 3" on the 3 on slot 5, and "not red 3" on the 3 on slot 3.
   - The 3 was clued on chop, and there is a red 3 in the discard pile. Thus, Bob should treat this is as a _Save Clue_ on red 3.
   - There are no playable 3's currently, so this cannot be a _Direct Play Clue_.
   - The only other possibility is if this 3 clue was a _Finesse_ of some sort. But Alice cannot give a _Self-Finesse_ this way - Alice would not expect Bob to blind-play due to the possibility of the 3 clue being a _Save Clue_. This is also not a _Reverse Finesse_ - although Cathy coincidentally has a red 2 on her finesse position, Cathy would interpret a clue touching a critical red 3 on chop as a _Save Clue_.
1. Bob should not blind-play anything off this clue. He can (and perhaps should) give 2 to Cathy as a _Play Clue_, picking up the other 2 "for free". This would not be stomping on a _Finesse_, since the red 2 could not have been gotten by a _Finesse_ to begin with.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question7 />

## Question 8

<Tabs
defaultValue="question8"
values={[
{label: 'Question', value: 'question8'},
{label: 'Solution', value: 'solution8'},
]}>
<TabItem value="question8">

- Bob has an unknown blue card in his hand.
- Cathy has an unknown 2 in her hand.
- What is the most valuable _Play Clue_ Alice can give?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution8">

- Alice only has one valid _Play Clue_: 2 to Cathy.
  - As tempting as it may seem, she cannot clue the red 3 (either with color or rank) to initiate a _Reverse Finesse_, because Cathy would proceed to play the unknown 2 as a red 2 (assuming a _Prompt_ over a _Finesse_).
  - She should avoid cluing red to Cathy, as it would touch the (trash) red 1.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question8 />

## Question 9

<Tabs
defaultValue="question9"
values={[
{label: 'Question', value: 'question9'},
{label: 'Solution', value: 'solution9'},
]}>
<TabItem value="question9">

- Bob has an unknown 5 in his hand.
- Cathy has an unknown yellow card in her hand.
- What is the most valuable _Play Clue_ Alice can give?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution9">

- Alice's most valuable _Play Clue_ is green to Bob's green 4, as a _Reverse Finesse_ that gets 2 previously untouched cards played.
  - Cathy's unknown card is also a 3, but she knows it is a yellow that cannot connect to a green 4.
  - Alice can also clue 3 to Cathy as a _Play Clue_, but this only touches one new card (the green 3) and fills in another.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question9 />

## Question 10

<Tabs
defaultValue="question10"
values={[
{label: 'Question', value: 'question10'},
{label: 'Solution', value: 'solution10'},
]}>
<TabItem value="question10">

- Bob has an unknown 5 in his hand.
- Cathy has an unknown purple card in her hand.
- What is the most valuable _Play Clue_ Alice can give?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution10">

- Alice's most valuable _Play Clue_ is 4 to Bob's red 4, as a _Self-Finesse_ that gets 2 previously untouched cards played.
  - Alice can expect Bob to play into the _Self-Finesse_ because there is no other explanation for the clue. It cannot be a _Save Clue_ or a _Direct Play Clue_, as there are no critical or immediately playable 4's. It cannot be a _Reverse Finesse_ on Cathy, since her green 4 on finesse position certainly does not connect to a 4.
  - Alice can also clue 3 to Cathy as a _Play Clue_, but then she would need to touch the red 4 later at some point anyways, "wasting" a clue.
