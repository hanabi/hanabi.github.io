## Question 1

<Tabs
defaultValue="question1"
values={[
{label: 'Question ', value: 'question1'},
{label: 'Solution', value: 'solution1'},
]}>
<TabItem value="question1">

- It is currently the _Early Game_. There is 1 clue token left.
- What action should Alice perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution1">

- The only legal move is for Alice to give a _5 Stall_ to Donald (touching the purple 5).
- There are no other legal _Play Clues_ or _Save Clues_ to give. And because a _5 Stall_ is possible, Alice is not allowed to discard.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 2

<Tabs
defaultValue="question2"
values={[
{label: 'Question ', value: 'question2'},
{label: 'Solution', value: 'solution2'},
]}>
<TabItem value="question2">

- Alice clues blue to Bob, which touches one card on slot 2.
- Bob writes a card note with the identity of the card.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write?
1. What action should Bob perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution2">

1. Bob writes "blue 2, blue 3 if blue 2 f".
   - Bob knows that this must be a _Play Clue_ on his blue card, since it is not on chop. Blue 2 has not been played and has not been touched elsewhere, so this card could be the blue 2.
   - However, Bob also sees a blue 2 on Cathy's _Finesse Position_, so Alice could have performed a _Reverse Finesse_. If that is the case, this card could be a blue 3.
1. Bob must entertain the possibility of a _Reverse Finesse_, so he cannot play the blue card immediately. Assuming there is nothing useful to clue in Alice's hand, Bob should just discard (and avoid cluing the blue 2).
   - If Cathy blind-plays her blue 2 on her turn, Bob can update his note to "blue 2, blue 3 if blue 2 f | blue 3".
   - If Cathy has nothing more urgent to do and still does not play her blue 2 on her turn, Bob can update his note with "blue 2, blue 3 if blue 2 f | blue 3".
