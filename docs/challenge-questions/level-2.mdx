## Question 1

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question1"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question1'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution1'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question1">

- It is currently the _Early Game_. There is 1 clue token left.
- What action should Alice perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution1">

- The only legal move is for Alice to give a _5 Stall_ to Donald (touching the purple 5).
- There are no other legal _Play Clues_ or _Save Clues_ to give. And because a _5 Stall_ is possible, Alice is not allowed to discard.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 2

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question2"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question2'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution2'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question2">

- Alice clues blue to Bob, which touches one card on slot 2.
- Bob writes a card note with the identity of the card.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write?
1. What action should Bob perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution2">

1. Bob writes "blue 2, blue 3 if blue 2 f".
   - Bob knows that this must be a _Play Clue_ on his blue card, since it is not on chop. Blue 2 has not been played and has not been touched elsewhere, so this card could be the blue 2.
   - However, Bob also sees a blue 2 on Cathy's _Finesse Position_, so Alice could have performed a _Reverse Finesse_. If that is the case, this card could be a blue 3.
1. Bob must entertain the possibility of a _Reverse Finesse_, so he cannot play the blue card immediately. Assuming there is nothing useful to clue in Alice's hand, Bob should just discard (and avoid cluing the blue 2).
   - If Cathy blind-plays her blue 2 on her turn, Bob can update his note to "blue 2, blue 3 if blue 2 f | blue 3".
   - If Cathy has nothing more urgent to do and still does not play her blue 2 on her turn, Bob can update his note with "blue 2, blue 3 if blue 2 f | blue 2".

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question2 />

## Question 3

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question3"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question3'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution3'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question3">

- Alice clues number 3 to Bob, which touches one card on slot 4. It has negative red and green on it.
- Bob writes a card note with the identity of the card.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write?
1. What action should Bob perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution3">

1. Bob writes a note of "yellow 3, blue 3, purple 3".
   - Bob knows that this must be a _Play Clue_ on his 3, since it is not on chop. Since there are no 2's played, the 3 is not directly playable. Normally, this would look like a _Reverse Finesse_ on Cathy's green 2, but since Bob's 3 has negative green, that is impossible.
   - Thus, this must be a _Self-Finesse_ and Bob must have the 2 to make his 3 playable.
   - Bob does not know exactly which 3 is playable until he plays his _Finesse Position_.
1. Bob needs to blind-play his _Finesse Position_ immediately to demonstrate that he (and not Cathy) has the connecting 2.
   - Cathy's chop is trash and does not need saving.
   - After playing the 2, Bob should mark his 3 with the same color as the 2 that was played.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 4

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question4"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question4'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution4'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question4">

- Alice clues number 2 to Bob, which touches a yellow 2 on slot 5.
- Bob discards trash from slot 4.
- From Cathy's perspective, was Alice's clue a _Reverse Finesse_? Why or why not?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution4">

- No, it is not a _Reverse Finesse_.
- Since the yellow 2 was on chop, Alice performed a normal _2 Save_.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question4 />

## Question 5

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question5"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question5'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution5'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question5">

- Alice clues number 3 to Bob, which touches one card on slot 2.
- Bob writes a card note with the identity of the card.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write?
1. What action should Bob perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution5">

1. Bob writes "red 3, blue 3, purple 3 if purple 2 f".
   - Bob knows that this must be a _Play Clue_ on his 3, since it is not on chop. It could be an immediately playable red 3 or blue 3, but it could also be a _Reverse Finesse_ on a purple 3.
1. Bob must entertain the possibility of a _Reverse Finesse_. For now, Bob needs to clue green to Cathy, which would be a _Critical Save_ on the critical green 3.
   - If Cathy blind-plays the purple 2, Bob will update his note to "red 3, blue 3, purple 3 if purple 2 f | purple 3".
   - If Cathy does not blind-play the purple 2, Bob will update his note to "red 3, blue 3, purple 3 if purple 2 f | red 3, blue 3".
   - (This cannot be a _Self-Finesse_ on Bob, since he knows that _Self-Finesses_ cannot be given if a _Play Clue_ interpretation is possible. In this case, the clued card could be an immediately playable red 3 or blue 3.)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question5 />

## Question 6

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question6"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question6'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution6'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question6">

- Alice clues number 4 to Bob, which touches a green 4 on slot 5.
- Bob discards trash from slot 4.
- From Cathy's perspective, was Alice's clue a _Reverse Finesse_? Why or why not?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution6">

- Yes, this is a _Reverse Finesse_.
- Green 4 is not critical, so the 4 clue cannot be a _Save Clue_. Thus, it must be a _Play Clue_. Cathy is promised a green 3 to make the green 4 playable.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question6 />

## Question 7

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question7"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question7'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution7'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question7">

- Alice clues number 3 to Bob, which touches two cards on slot 3 and slot 5.
- This is a _Chop Focus_ clue, which means that slot 5 is focused.
- Bob writes a card note on both of the cards.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write on each card?
1. What action should Bob perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution7">

1. Bob writes "red 3" on the slot 5 card, and "yellow 3, green 3, blue 3, purple 3" on the slot 3 card.
   - Since Bob got a _Chop Focus_ clue, he should treat it as a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_.
   - However, there are no directly playable 3's, so this cannot be a direct _Play Clue_.
   - The only 3 in the trash is the red 3, so this must be a _Save Clue_ on a red 3.
   - This cannot be a _Self-Finesse_, because Alice would expect Bob to treat the clue as a _Save Clue_ on the red 3.
   - This cannot be a _Reverse Finesse_. Even though Cathy has a red 2 on her _Finesse Position_, Cathy would interpret a clue touching a critical red 3 on chop as a _Save Clue_. Thus, she would never blind-play anything from Alice's clue.
1. Assuming that Alice has no cards of interest, Bob should clue number 2 to Cathy as a _Play Clue_ on the red 2. (A number 2 clue is better than a red clue because it gets the purple 2 "for free".)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question7 />

## Question 8

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question8"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question8'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution8'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question8">

- Bob has an unknown blue card in his hand.
- Cathy has an unknown 2 in her hand.
- What is the best clue that Alice can give?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution8">

- Alice only has one valid clue: number 2 to Cathy.
- Alice cannot clue the red 3 (with either color or rank) to initiate a _Reverse Finesse_, because Cathy would proceed to play the unknown 2 as a red 2 (assuming a _Prompt_ over a _Finesse_).
- Alice should avoid cluing red to Cathy, as it would violate _Good Touch Principle_ and touch the trash red 1.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question8 />

## Question 9

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question9"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question9'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution9'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question9">

- Bob has an unknown 5 in his hand.
- Cathy has an unknown yellow card in her hand.
- What is the best clue that Alice can give?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution9">

- Alice's most valuable clue is green to Bob. This would be a _Play Clue_ on the green 4 and initiate a _Reverse Finesse_.
- Unlike the previous question, the _Reverse Finesse_ will work because Cathy knows that her yellow card cannot connect to a green 4.
- Alice could also clue number 3 to Cathy as a _Play Clue_ on the green 3. This would also "fill in" the yellow 3. But it would only be "get" one brand new card instead of two brand new cards.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Question9 />

## Question 10

<Tabs
  defaultValue="question10"
  values={[
    {label: 'Question', value: 'question10'},
    {label: 'Solution', value: 'solution10'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="question10">

- Bob has an unknown 5 in his hand.
- Cathy has an unknown purple card in her hand.
- What is the best clue that Alice can give?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution10">

- Alice's most valuable clue is number 4 to Bob. This would be a _Play Clue_ on the red 4 and initiate a _Self Finesse_.
- Alice can expect that Bob to play into the _Self-Finesse_ because:
  - Bob will know that the number 4 clue cannot be a _Save Clue_. (No 4's are currently critical.)
  - Bob will know that the number 4 clue cannot be a direct _Play Clue_, since there are no immediately playable 4's.
  - Bob will know that the number 4 clue cannot be a _Reverse Finesse_, because Cathy does not have any playable cards on her _Finesse Position_ that connect to a 4.
- Alice could also clue number 3 to Bob as a _Play Clue_ on the red 3. She could also clue number 4 to Cathy as a _Play Clue_ on the green 4. However, both fo these clues would only be "get" one brand new card instead of two brand new cards.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
