- Alice clues number 3 to Bob, which touches one card on slot 4. It has negative red and green on it.
- Bob writes a card note with the identity of the card.

1. What _card note_ does Bob write?
1. What action should Bob perform?

<TabItem value="solution">

1. Bob writes a note of "y3, p3".
   - Bob knows that this must be a _Play Clue_ on his 3, since it is not on chop. Since there are no 2's played, the 3 is not directly playable. Normally, this would look like a _Reverse Finesse_ on Cathy's green 2, but since Bob's 3 has negative green, that is impossible.
   - Thus, this must be a [_Self-Finesse_](../level-2.mdx#the-self-finesse) and Bob must have the 2 to make his 3 playable.
   - Bob does not know exactly which 3 is playable until he plays his _Finesse Position_.
1. Bob needs to blind-play his _Finesse Position_ immediately to demonstrate that he (and not Cathy) has the connecting 2.
   - Cathy's chop is trash and does not need saving.
   - After playing the 2, Bob should mark his 3 with the same color as the 2 that was played.
