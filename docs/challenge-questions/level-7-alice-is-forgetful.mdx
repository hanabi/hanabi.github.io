- All the 2's are played on the stacks.
- There are 0 clues available.
- Alice has a globally known red 3 in her hand.
- Alice forgets to play her red 3 and instead discards her chop.
- What notes should Bob write? What should Bob do on his turn?

<Question />

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice is not forgetful, she deliberately discarded instead of playing her known playable card.
- Alice is performing a [_Scream Discard Chop Move_](../level-7.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm).
- By discarding instead of playing her known playable card, Alice is screaming at Bob that his chop is critical or playable.
- Bob should permanently move his chop by one position, and write "cm" on his slot 4 to mark it as _Chop Moved_.
- Bob is not allowed to discard on this turn. Instead, he **must** give a clue.
