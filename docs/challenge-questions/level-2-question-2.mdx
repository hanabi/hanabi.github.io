1. What _card note_ does Bob write?
1. What action should Bob perform?

<TabItem value="solution">

1. Bob writes "b2, b3 if blue 2 f".
   - Bob knows that this must be a _Play Clue_ on his blue card, since it is not on chop. Blue 2 has not been played and has not been touched elsewhere, so this card could be the blue 2.
   - However, Bob also sees a blue 2 on Cathy's _Finesse Position_, so Alice could have performed a _Reverse Finesse_. If that is the case, this card could be a blue 3.
1. Bob must entertain the possibility of a _Reverse Finesse_, so he cannot play the blue card immediately. Assuming there is nothing useful to clue in Alice's hand, Bob should just discard (and avoid cluing the blue 2).
   - If Cathy blind-plays her blue 2 on her turn, Bob can update his note to "b2, b3 if blue 2 f | b3".
   - If Cathy has nothing more urgent to do and still does not play her blue 2 on her turn, Bob can update his note with "b2, b3 if blue 2 f | b2".
