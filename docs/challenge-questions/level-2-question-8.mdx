- Bob has an unknown blue card in his hand.
- Cathy has an unknown 2 in her hand.
- What is the best clue that Alice can give?

<Question />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice only has one valid clue: number 2 to Cathy.
- Alice cannot clue the red 3 (with either color or rank) to initiate a _Reverse Finesse_, because Cathy would proceed to play the unknown 2 as a red 2 (assuming a _Prompt_ over a _Finesse_).
- Alice should avoid cluing red to Cathy, as it would violate _Good Touch Principle_ and touch the trash red 1.
