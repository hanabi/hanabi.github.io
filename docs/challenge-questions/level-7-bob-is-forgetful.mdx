- All the 2's have been played on the stacks.
- Alice uses the last clue to clue number 4 to Cathy. This is a _Finesse_ on Bob's red 3.
- Bob is now left with 0 clues, but forgets to play his red 3 and instead discards his chop.
- What notes should Cathy write? What should Cathy do on her turn?

<TabItem value="solution">

- Bob is not forgetful, he deliberately discarded instead of blind-playing his _Finessed_ card.
- From [_Urgency Principle_](../level-5.mdx#urgency-principle-playing-into-finesses-as-soon-as-possible), blind-plays should happen as soon as possible, and if Bob just had blind-played his red 3, Cathy could easily play her red 4.
- So this is in fact **not** a [_Scream Discard_](../level-7.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm), because Bob's known play was from a _Finesse_, and Cathy might actually also have a red 3 on her _Finesse Position_ (from an _Ambiguous Finesse_).
- Therefore, Cathy should not _Chop Move_ anything, and instead blind-play her _Finesse Position_, expecting it to be the other red 3.
