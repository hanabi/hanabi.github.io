- Red 3, yellow 5, green 3, blue 3, and purple 5 are played on the stacks.
- Alice has a [_Chop Moved_](../level-4.mdx#the-5s-chop-move-5cm) card from several turns ago with a negative 5 clue.
- Should Alice blind-play this card? What are the considerations?

<TabItem value="solution">

- The answer to whether Alice should blind-play is that **it depends** on multiple factors.
- Alice must first figure out whether this card is safe to play:
  - It cannot be a 5 (from the negative clue), so it is not _Critical_.
  - It _can_ be a red 4, green 4, or blue 4, which would successfully play.
  - It can also be any other card in the game, which would cause a strike to happen.
  - Since the card has been _Chop Moved_, it is more likely to be a useful card than not.
- Thus, since the outcomes from blind-playing are either a successful play or a strike, Alice can proceed with further considerations. (If the card was _Critical_, then she should definitely not risk playing it.)
- According to the [_Blind-Playing Chop Moved Cards_](../level-7.mdx#blind-playing-chop-moved-cards) section, players can blind-play their _Chop Moved_ cards if the team has one or more strikes to spare.
- Thus:
  - If the team has 0 strikes, Alice will probably want to try blind-playing the card.
  - If the team has 1 strike, Alice might want to try blind-playing the card.
  - If the team has 2 strike, Alice should absolutely not try blind-playing the card.
- If the team has 0 or 1 strikes, the final consideration is how well the current game is going. What is the current _Tempo_ and _Efficiency_? In other words, how much time is left and how many future clues are left?
  - If the game is already going well, then there is no need to risk blind-playing anything. Alice can just discard normally and wait for one of her team members to clue the card directly.
  - If the _End-Game_ has arrived and there are not very many clues to spare, then Alice can try blind-playing the card to save the team a clue.
