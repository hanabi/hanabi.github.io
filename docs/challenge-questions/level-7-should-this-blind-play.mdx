- Red 3, yellow 5, green 3, blue 3, and purple 5 have been played on the stacks.
- Alice has a [_Chop Moved_](../level-4.mdx#the-5s-chop-move-5cm) card from several turns ago, with a negative 5 clue.
- Should Alice blind-play this card? What are the considerations?

<Question />

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice must first figure out whether this card is safe to play:
  - It cannot be a 5 (from negative clues), so it is not _Critical_.
  - It _can_ be a red, green or blue 4, which would successfully play.
  - It can also be any other card in the game, which would cause a strike to happen.
  - Since the card has been chop moved, it is more likely to be a useful card than not.
- According to the [_Blind-Playing Chop Moved Cards_](../level-7.mdx#blind-playing-chop-moved-cards) principle, players should blind-play their _Chop Moved_ cards if they have a pretty good chance of being playable, and if the team has one or more strikes to spare.
- **If the team has a strike to spare**, Alice should risk playing the card, since it is more efficient than waiting for a teammate to clue the card.

<AnswerPart1 />

- However, if the team does **not** have a strike to spare, misplaying the card could lose the game, so Alice should **not** risk playing the card.
- She should instead discard her chop (or find a useful clue to give), waiting for the other players to tell her whether to play this card or not.
