- All the 1's are played on the stacks.
- Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a card on slot 3. (This is a _Trash Chop Move_.)
- Bob clues blue to Cathy, touching _all_ cards in Bob's hand.
- What notes should be written on Cathy's cards?
- What should Cathy do next?

<TabItem value="solution">

- After Alice's _Trash Chop Move_, Cathy's chop moved to slot 2.
- Bob's clue has normal _Chop Focus_, and is focused on slot 2.
- There are no blue cards in the discard pile, so it is a _Play Clue_ on a blue 2.
- The blue 1 on slot 3 is still trash.
- The other blue cards are from _Good Touch Principle_ assumed to be blue 3, 4 and 5, but the order is not known.
- Slot 4 and slot 5 are no longer _Chop Moved_, as they now have been touched by a clue.
- Cathy should play the blue 2.
