- It is the first turn of the game.
- Alice clues number 1 to Bob.
- The order of playing these 1s is from right to left.

<QuestionPart1 />

- Bob plays the rightmost one. It successfully plays as red 1. (Bob draws a new card.)
- Cathy does something unrelated.
- Alice clues red to Bob. It touches Bob's chop. This must be a _Play Clue_ on a red 2.

<QuestionPart2 />

- Bob plays his slot 5 one. It successfully plays as blue 1. (Bob draws a new card.)
- Cathy does something unrelated.
- Alice gives Bob a number 1 clue again, touching Bob's two new cards as well as re-touching the 1s from his starting hand.
- Which card is Bob expected to play?

<TabItem value="solution">

- Sometimes, fresh 1s are touched in the same hand as 1s that have not played yet.
- When this happens, the play-order notes on previous 1s are erased and the order of playing the 1s is re-calculated.
- For this calculation, the precedence remains the same:
  - Chop
  - Fresh 1s (left to right)
  - Starting Hand 1s (right to left)
- Thus:
  - Bob erases the notes on his 1s.
  - Bob's slot 2 is chop, so Bob writes "1st" on it.
  - Bob's slot 1 card is a fresh 1, he writes "2nd" on it.
  - Bob's slot 4 and slot 5 cards are 1s from his starting hand. He writes "3rd" on slot 5 and "4th" on slot 4.
  - Additionally, Bob knows that he has four 1s in his hand and only three 1s need to be played. Thus, from _Good Touch Principle_, his 1 on slot 4 will never play, so he marks it as known-trash.
  - Bob is expected to play his slot 2 card. It successfully plays as yellow 1.
