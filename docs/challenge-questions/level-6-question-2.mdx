- Bob has one clued, but otherwise unknown card in his hand: a green card in slot 4.
- Alice clues 3 to Bob, which touches his card in slot 4 and "fills it in".
- What actions will Bob take on his next turn?

<TabItem value="solution">

- Since Bob's card was already "gotten" when Alice clued, this must be a _Tempo Clue_.
- The clue gets a single new card to become playable within the next turn.
- Thus, the clue is not considered to be "valuable" enough; it must have a deeper meaning.
- Bob knows that a non-valuable _Tempo Clue_ actually _Chop Moves_ the card currently on the chop.
- Bob performs the following actions:
  - Bob marks his slot 3 card as being _Chop Moved_ with a "cm" note on the card.
  - Bob will play the green 3 card from slot 4 on his next turn.
