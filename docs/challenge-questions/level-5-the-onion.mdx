- The red 2, the yellow 1 and the green 1 are played on the stacks.
- Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: `blue 1, blue 2, green 1, yellow 4`
- Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: `green 2, purple 1, purple 2, yellow 2 (clued with 2)`
- Alice clues 3 to Donald, touching a 3 on slot 2.
- What notes should Donald write on his card? Be specific.

<Question />

<TabItem value="solution">

- There are no 3's in the discard pile, so it is definitively a _Play_ clue.
- It can certainly be a straight up _Play_ clue on the **red 3**, since it's directly playable.
- It can also be a **yellow 3**, as a [_Prompt_](../level-1.mdx#the-prompt) on Cathy's yellow 2.
- It can also be a **green 3**, as a [_Hidden Finesse_](../level-5.mdx#the-hidden-finesse) on Cathy's yellow 2 and green 2.
- It can also be a **blue 3**, as a [_Double Finesse_](../level-2.mdx#the-double-finesse--triple-finesse--quadruple-finesse) on Bob's blue cards.
- Finally, it can be a **purple 3**, as a _Hidden_, [_Clandestine_](../level-5.mdx#the-clandestine-finesse), [_Layered Finesse_](../level-5.mdx#the-layered-finesse) on all of Cathy's cards.
- So Donald must initially mark all these cards as possibly being finessed, and his 3 can be any card in the game.

<Answer />

- If Bob blind-plays, Donald can mark his card as the blue 3, and erase all finesse notes except on the blue 2.
- If Bob doesn't blind play, he can erase is `b3` note, but _cannot_ play the card until Cathy has stopped playing cards.
