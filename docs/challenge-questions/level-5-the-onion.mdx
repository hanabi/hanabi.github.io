- Alice clues 3 to Donald, touching a 3 on slot 2.

- It can be a red 3 as a "normal" _Play Clue_.
- It can be a yellow 3 as a [_Prompt_](../level-1.mdx#the-prompt) on Cathy's yellow 2.
- It can be a green 3, as a [_Hidden Finesse_](../level-5.mdx#the-hidden-finesse) on Cathy's green 2. (The yellow 2 will play first as green 2.)
- It can be a blue 3, as a [_Double Finesse_](../level-2.mdx#the-double-finesse--triple-finesse--quadruple-finesse) on Bob's blue 1 and blue 2.
- It can be a purple 3, as a [_Clandestine Finesse_](../level-5.mdx#the-clandestine-finesse) on all of Cathy's cards. (This is technically called a [Surreptitious Finesse](../extras/special-finesses.mdx#the-surreptitious-finesse), but you do not have to worry about the distinction at level 5.)
- Donald should write a note that includes all of these possibilities: `r3, y3 if y2 p, g3 if g2 f, b3 if b1 f, p3 if p1 f`
