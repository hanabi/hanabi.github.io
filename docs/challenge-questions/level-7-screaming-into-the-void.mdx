- All the 2's have been played on the stacks.
- There are 0 clues available.
- Alice has a known playable green 3.
- Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: `yellow 3 (globally known), red 2, blue 4, purple 5`.
- What should Alice do this turn?

<Question />

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice should play her green 3 normally.
- Since Bob can play his yellow 3, the purple 5 is not in immediate danger of being discarded.
- The [_Scream Discard_](../level-7.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm) is only used as a last resort when the next player has no other option but to discard.
- Alice should trust that Bob will play his card.
