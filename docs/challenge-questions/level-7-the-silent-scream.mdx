- There are 2 clues available.
- Yellow 1, green 2 and blue 2 have been played on the stacks. All other stacks are empty.
- Alice has a globally known playable green 3 and a known-trash yellow 1.
- Bob has a blue 4 on chop.
- Alice discards the known-trash yellow 1 instead of playing the green 3.
- Is this move legal? If so, what is this move called?
- How should Bob react?

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice discarded a known trash instead of playing her known playable card.
- This is a legal move, even if the _Chop Moved_ card is not critical or playable and/or there are available clues
- This move is called a [_Shout Discard Chop Move_](../level-7.mdx#the-shout-discard-chop-move).
- Bob should permanently move his chop by one position, and write "cm" on his slot 4 to mark it as _Chop Moved_.
- Bob is not allowed to discard on this turn. Instead, he **must** give a clue.
