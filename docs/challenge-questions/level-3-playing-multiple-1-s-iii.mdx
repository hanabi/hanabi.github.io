- It is the first turn of the game.
- Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching two cards on slot 3 and 4.
- Immediately, Bob clues number 1 to Cathy, touching the same two cards.
- What notes should Cathy write on her cards. What should she do next?

<Question />

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice's clue tells Cathy to play the 1's from right to left.
- Bob's clue is a _Fix Clue (That Gives No Additional Information)_.
- This means that Cathy should _not_ play the expected card (slot 4), but skip to slot 3 and play that card instead.
