- All the 2's have been played on the stacks.
- There are 0 clues available.
- Alice has a globally known yellow 2 in her hand.
- Alice decides to hold on to her trash and discards her chop instead.
- What signal is Alice sending? What should Bob do?

<Question />

<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice is performing a [_Scream Discard Chop Move (With Known-Trash)_](../level-7.mdx#the-scream-discard-chop-move-with-known-trash).
- Normally, players are expected to discard their known-trash cards before discarding their chop.
- By discarding her chop instead of the known-trash card, Alice is signaling that something is very wrong — specifically, that Bob's chop is critical or playable.
- Bob should permanently move his chop by one position, and write "cm" on his slot 4 to mark it as _Chop Moved_.
- Bob is not allowed to discard on this turn. Instead, he **must** give a clue.
