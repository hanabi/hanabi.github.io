<TabItem value="solution">

- There are two legal things for Alice to do:
  - First, Alice can perform a _5 Stall_ to Donald (by cluing number 5 to touch the purple 5).
  - Second, Alice can discard.
- If Alice performs a _5 Stall_, then Bob's action would be to discard (since there are no clue tokens left).
- If Bob discarded, he would discard a green 1, which is considered to be an excellent discard (since it is already played and is thus considered to be trash).
- Alice could have a more desirable card on chop than a green 1, like a yellow 3 or a blue 3.
- Thus, while it is permissible for Alice to either _5 Stall_ or discard, her best action is to perform a _5 Stall_, since her chop is more valuable than Bob's chop.
