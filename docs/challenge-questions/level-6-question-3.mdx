- The red 2 card is played on the stacks.
- Alice has a red card in slot 3, promised to be a playable red 4.
- Bob has an unknown 5, saved on chop.
- Cathy has a red card in slot 2, promised to be a playable red 3.
- Alice then gives a red clue to Bob, that touches a red card on slot 1 and fills-in the previously unknown red 5 in slot 5.
- What actions will Bob take on his turn?

- In this situation, the focus of the red clue is ambiguous:
  - If the red clue were focused on the "new" slot 1 card, then the focus would be _Trash_, so the resulting move would be a _Trash Chop Move_ on slots 2, 3 and 4.
  - If the red clue were focused on the already-clued slot 5, then the focus would be the previously-unknown-to-be-playable red 5, so the resulting move would be a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_ on slot 4.
  - Bob also knows that _Tempo Clue Chop Moves_ have precedence over _Trash Chop Moves_.
  - Thus, in this situation, Bob should only _Chop Move_ the card in slot 4.
  - Bob writes "cm" on his slot 4 card and proceeds to give an unrelated clue or discards his slot 1 card.
