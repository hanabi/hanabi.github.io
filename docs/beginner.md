# The Beginner's Guide

<br />

## Intro

- Are you looking to start playing Hanabi with the *Hyphen-ated Group*? Fantastic - we are always looking to welcome new players. Take 30 minutes and go through this guide so that you can get up to speed with the basics.
- Alternatively, are you looking to learn some solid fundamental strategies to use to play Hanabi with your own group of friends? Feel free to adopt these strategies.
- Is a 30 minute briefing really necessary? Well, yes and no. If you try to play with our group and don't understand what basic clues mean, it is going to be analogous to a group of people trying to find each other in a dark room by running around with their arms flailing.
- We know that 30 minutes might be too long for some people to sit through. So, we've tried to split up the guide into bite-sized chunks with fun challenge questions at the end of every section in order to keep you interested.

## Warning

- Note that the beginner's guide assumes that you are already familiar with the basic rules of Hanabi. If you need to brush up on them, either [read them here](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/blob/master/docs/RULES.md) or [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrFCekQb4nY).
- If you know the rules but you've *never actually played* Hanabi, then it might be best to play a practice game or two before reading the guide so that you are more familiar with the game mechanics.
