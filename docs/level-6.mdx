## Special Moves

<br />

### The Order Chop Move (OCM)

- First, see the section on [Playing Multiple 1's](level-3.mdx#playing-multiple-1s).
- We agree that unknown 1's are supposed to be played in a particular order. If a player has unknown 1's and does **not** play them in the correct order, it means that they are trying to send an additional message.
- If a player skips over **one** of the 1's, and there is nothing else special going on, it means that the next player should _Chop Move_ one card.
- If a player skips over **two** of the 1s, the message skips over the next player, and the player after that should _Chop Move_ one card.
- A skip of **three** 1's means that the player three seats away should _Chop Move_, and so on.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Bob number 1, which touches three 1's. They are in slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  - Bob is expected to play slot 3 (which is the oldest 1). If he plays slot 3, nothing special happens.
  - If Bob plays slot 2, then he is skipping over one card. Cathy should _Chop Move_ one card (her slot 5).
  - If Bob plays slot 1, he is skipping over two cards. Alice should _Chop Move_ one card (her slot 5).

<OrderChopMove />

- If a player decides to do an _Order Chop Move_, on their next turn, they should revert to the original order again.
- For example, continuing from the previous example:
  - Bob decides to play slot 2, performing an _Order Chop Move_ on Cathy.
  - Cathy marks her slot 5 card as being _Chop Moved_. Then, Cathy gives an unrelated clue.
  - Alice gives an unrelated clue.
  - Now, Bob has two 1's left in slot 2 and slot 3.
  - Bob is expected to play slot 3 (which is the oldest 1). If he plays slot 3, nothing special happens.
  - If Bob plays slot 2, he is performing another _Order Chop Move_, and Cathy should _Chop Move_ one card. (It would be her slot 4, since her slot 5 is already _Chop Moved_.)
- There are some other common situations that do **not** imply an _Order Chop Move_. Use your common sense! Here is a short list:
  - The 1 that was played has a **different amount of positive clues** than the other 1's. (Different negative clues are ignored.)
  - The 1 that was played was originally _Finessed_ from a clue that happened **before** the number 1 clue.
  - The 1 that was skipped over is known to be bad from contextual information.
- The _Order Chop Move_ only applies to 1s. If it happens with any card that is not a 1, then it is never an _Order Chop Move_ and it just means nothing.

<br />

### The Trash Order Chop Move (TOCM)

- First, see the section on the _[Order Chop Move](#the-order-chop-move-ocm)_.
- Sometimes, a player will have two known-trash cards in their hand (and these cards are explicitly known-trash, meaning that everyone on the team can equally see that they are known-trash).
- In this situation, the player is expected to discard the newest (left-most) trash card.
- Thus, if a player skips over their newest trash card and instead discards the second newest trash card, they must be trying to communicate something extra.
- This means that the next player should _Chop Move_ (in a manner similar to a _Order Chop Move_).
- Note that a player is not necessarily trying to perform a _Trash Order Chop Move_ if the two trash cards have different kinds of clues on them. For example, by discarding specific trash cards, it can communicate that the player "sees" all of the non-trash possibilities of that card.

<br />

### The Scream Discard Chop Move (SDCM)

- The _Chop Move_ is a tool to save multiple cards with one clue. However, sometimes you may not have a clue at all. One way to solve this situation is with a special kind of discard.
- Typically, discarding is a last resort. So, if you have a known playable card in your hand, you can send a powerful message to your teammate by discarding a card instead. This is called a _Scream Discard_. Since your teammate expected you to play, it is like screaming at them to let them know that things are very bad.
- A _Scream Discard_ does two things:
  1. The player being "screamed at" should permanently move their chop by one position.
  1. The player being "screamed at" is not allowed to discard on this turn. Instead, they must give a clue. If there are no normal _Play Clues_ or _Save Clues_ to give, then they are allowed to give "stall" clues, like a _5 Stall_. If there are no _5 Stalls_ to give, they can even just "fill-in" some information on an already-clued card (and doing this should not cause a _Finesse_).
- Players are **only allowed** to _Scream Discard_ for **cards that are playable or critical** (or a needed 2 that isn't seen anywhere else). (This follows from _Save Principle_.)
- Players are **only allowed** to _Scream Discard_ as an absolute last resort. This means _Scream Discards_ are almost always performed **while the team is at 0 clues**. (Less commonly, they can also be performed if the team is at 1 clue and the next person happens to be _Locked_.)
- Players are **not** allowed to _Scream Discard_ for cards that are _one-away-from-playable_.
- Players are **not** allowed to _Scream Discard_ if there was some other, less dangerous way to save the card. It is a "last resort" move.
- Sometimes, a player will discard with a known-playable card in their hand, but they are **not** intending a _Scream Discard_ - it is some other special situation:
  1. It is not a _Scream Discard_ if the next player **has** to generate a clue for cluing the next player after that. This is called a _Generation Discard_; see below.
  1. It is not a _Scream Discard_ when the card that the player did not play was a "blind" card from a _Finesse_ **and** the blind card could also be in the next player's _Finesse Position_.

<br />

### The Generation Discard

- Usually, if someone discards a card instead of playing a known playable card, this would indicate a _Scream Discard Chop Move_.
- However, if playing the card (player 1) would cause the next player to discard (player 2) and the next player after that (player 3) to have a critical and/or playable card "ride" on chop, it is a very bad situation. Thus, the discard is **just** for the purposes of generating a clue so that player 2 can clue player 3.
- The _Generation Discard_ is **only** to be used as a last resort. If player 3 has something else to do (like play a card or give some obvious clue), then player 1 should just play their card and let the card "ride" on chop.

<br />

### A Scream Discard Flowchart

[Here is a flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/main/static/img/flowcharts/scream-discard-flowchart.png) for determining whether something is a _Scream Discard Chop Move_ or a _Generation Discard_. (Ignore the _Echo Scream Discard Chop Move_ for now.)

<br />

### The Tempo Clue

- _Tempo Clues_ are defined as clues that "get" no new cards. The purpose of a _Tempo Clue_ is to get 1 or more cards played that **already** had a clue on them.
  - If a clue is given to a card that is **already** known to be playable, then that would **not** count as a _Tempo Clue_. It would instead be a _Burn Clue_ (i.e. a clue that accomplishes nothing).
- As explained in the beginner's guide, we do not typically perform _Tempo Clues_, because they do not meet _[Minimum Clue Value Principle](first-principles.mdx#2-minimum-clue-value-principle)_.
- When a _Tempo Clue_ touches multiple cards, the focus is on the left-most card.
  - The exception is if one of the cards was previously _Chop Moved_. In that case, the focus is on the left-most _Chop Moved_ card.
- If a _Tempo Clue_ touches multiple cards, it typically means that all the touched cards are playable. See the _Double Tempo Clue_ section below.
- We treat _Tempo Clues_ differently depending on whether they are valuable or not valuable. See the next two sections below.

<br />

### The Valuable Tempo Clue

- In some special situations, _Tempo Clues_ have enough value to justify giving them:
  1. When it gets two or more clued cards to play
  1. When the clued card is not a 5 and it is "out of order" (meaning that it is impossible for a _Prompt_ to get the card played)
  1. When the clued card was _Chop Moved_ and it is now playable
  1. When playing the clued card would "unlock" someone's hand (see the section on _Locked Hands_ later on)
- If a _Tempo Clue_ is given in any of these situations, it is considered to be "valuable".
- Valuable _Tempo Clues_ can be given at any time. They don't have any special rules associated with them and they are treated in exactly the same way a "normal" _Play Clue_ is.

<br />

### The Tempo Clue Stall (A Non-Valuable Tempo Clue)

- If a player gives a _Tempo Clue_ that does **not** meet any of the criteria for being "valuable", it is treated differently and given a different name.
- Sometimes, players are in "stalling situations" where it would be illegal for them to discard (like when they have a hand that is completely clued). In some specific stalling situations, it is okay to give a _Tempo Clue_ that doesn't meet the criteria for being valuable. This is called a _Tempo Clue Stall_. Since everyone sees that the player giving the clue was in a stalling situation, they can understand what is going on.
- For level 8 players, see the _[Allowable Stall Clues](level-8.mdx#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table)_ section for the specific times when _Tempo Clue Stalls_ are okay to give. If you are lower than level 8, the details are not important right now.
- Obviously, players are **only** allowed to give a _Tempo Clue Stall_ in a valid stalling situation. If a player gives a _Tempo Clue_ that does not meet the criteria to be valuable in an otherwise ordinary situation, then they must be intending to send a deeper message. See the _Tempo Clue Chop Moves_ section below.

<br />

### The Tempo Clue Chop Move (TCCM)

- First, see the section on _[Tempo Clues](#the-tempo-clue)_.
- A _Tempo Clue Stall_ that is given in non-stalling situation can't be a stall - the cluer must be intending to send a deeper message.
- We agree that _Tempo Clues_ of this nature cause a _Chop Move_ in addition to getting the focus of the card to play.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which touches two cards on slot 1 and slot 2.
  - Bob plays red 1 from slot 1. The red card in slot 2 could be red 2, red 3, red 4, or red 5.
  - Cathy clues number 2 to Bob, which does not introduce any new cards, but it does "fill in" his slot 2 card.
  - Bob now knows that he has exactly red 2 on slot 2 and that this was a _Tempo Clue_. Since it does not get any new cards and only get _Tempo_ on one card in total, he knows that he should also _Chop Move_ his slot 5 card.
- Valuable _Tempo Clues_ can never cause a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_.
- When determining if a _Tempo Clue_ is "valuable", it should only be evaluated on the turn immediately after the clue is given. (This helps keeps things simple and prevents desynchronization.)

<TempoClueChopMovePart1 />

<hr />

<TempoClueChopMovePart2 />

- Normally, when two cards are retouched with a clue, it is a _Double Tempo Clue_ and the player should play both cards. However, this interpretation does not apply if the second card is strictly not playable. In this situation, all players can see that since only one card is getting _Tempo_, the interpretation of the clue should be a _Tempo Clue Chop Move_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Green 4 is in the trash.
  - Bob has:
    - a green 4 on slot 3 with no clues on it yet (on chop and critical)
    - a red 2 on slot 4 with a 2 clue on it
    - a red 5 on slot 5 with a 5 clue on it
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which re-touches his slot 4 card and his slot 5 card, "filling" both of them in.
  - Bob knows that this is a _Tempo Clue_, and plays red 2.
  - In most cases, since two cards were re-touched, they should both be playable. However, Bob knows that the red 5 is strictly not playable right now. Thus, since the clue did not get any new cards and only got _Tempo_ on one card in total, he knows that he should also _Chop Move_ his slot 3 card.
  - Cathy knows that no-one else on the team is promised the red 3 and the red 4.

<TempoClueChopMovePart3 />

<br />

### The Double Tempo Clue (A Valuable Tempo Clue)

- First, see the section on _[Tempo Clues](#the-tempo-clue)_ and _[Valuable Tempo Clues](#the-valuable-tempo-clue)_.
- When a _Tempo Clue_ touches one card, it is a clear signal to play that card.
- When a _Tempo Clue_ touches two or more cards, we need to agree how many cards that it promises are playable.
- We agree that it means that **all** of the cards touched are playable in order from left to right.
- Since this kind of clue gets two or more cards played, it is considered to be "valuable" and is allowed to be given at any time and in any situation.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, which touches slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  - Bob plays red 1 from slot 1. The other two red cards in his hand could be nearly anything.
  - Cathy clues red to Bob, which does not introduce any new cards, but it does re-touch slot 2 and slot 3.
  - Bob knows that this is a _Double Tempo_ clue. Both must be playable in order, so he must have red 2 in slot 2, and red 3 in slot 3.
- Note that the normal "play all the cards" interpretation does not apply in some special situations:
  - when the clue unlocks a player's hand
  - when the clue got 2+ cards played in total (using cards in someone else's hand)
  - when the clue touched a _Chop Moved_ card; in this situation, **only** the _Chop Moved_ card is playable

<br />

## General Principles

<br />

### Lines

- During your turn, part of figuring out the best move involves looking into the future to see what the next player will do. If they discard, will it be okay? Is there some obvious clue that they will do? And so on.
- As you get better at Hanabi, you will need to do this prediction not just for the next player, but for an entire go-around of the table. And as you really get good at Hanabi, you will need to do this for as far in the future as you can reasonably predict. (Sometimes, this means 15 moves or more in the future.)
- Similar to chess, initiating a move in which you can predict the next sequence of moves is called initiating a "line".
- In post-game reviews, we will often compare and hypothetically "play through" two different lines to see which one is better.

<br />

### The All 4's Test

- According to _Save Principle_, the team must not let any critical and/or playable cards be discarded. So part of constructing a line is figuring out whether this might happen.
- When considering a line, it is not safe to assume that a player will clue anything in your hand. You should perform the _All 4's Test_: what would everyone do if I have all useless 4's in my hand? If a critical and/or playable card would get discarded, then the line has failed the test, and it is probably a bad idea.

<br />

### Discard Modulation

- Often times, either you or the player who comes after you can perform a clue. And the clue would have the same result if done by either player. So who should do it?
- One way to decide is to look at the next player's chop. Is their chop high-value, low-value, or useless? If it is high-value, then you should discard and let them give the clue. If it is low-value or useless, then you should give the clue and let them discard.
- "Stealing" clues in this way is called _Discard Modulation_. If other players are discarding to let you give all of the clues, you might have a high-value chop.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - It is the _Mid-Game_.
  - Bob has a red 3 on chop. This is a _one-away-from-playable_ card that is valuable to the team. However, it would be illegal to clue the card directly with a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_.
  - Cathy has a (playable) blue 2 in her hand.
  - Alice decides to discard instead of giving a _Play Clue_ herself.
  - Bob clues blue to Cathy as a _Play Clue_.
  - Alice has smartly prevented the discard of the red 3, at least for a little while.

<DiscardModulation />

### The Value of One-Away-From-Playable Cards

- In general, 3's are pretty high value, and 4's are pretty low value.
- But combined with this, cards that are _one-away-from-playable_ are pretty high value, and cards that are two-away (or more) are pretty low value.
- Thus, in some situations, a _one-away-from-playable_ 4 may be more valuable than a _two-away-from-playable_ 3.
- According to our conventions, it is illegal to clue a _one-away-from-playable_ card as the focus of the clue without it being some kind of special move like a _Finesse_. However, sometimes we still want to "save" these cards. Thus, they are prime targets for indirect saves like the _Trash Chop Move_ or the _5's Chop Move_.
- However, in most cases, _Chop Moving_ the valuable card just won't be possible. So in general, you should try to construct lines that protect high-value cards from being discarded for as long as possible.

<br />

### Blind-Playing Chop Moved Cards

- Often times, cards are _Chop Moved_ towards the beginning of the game. Normally, once the time comes, the _Chop Moved_ card will be directly clued in order to get it to play.
- However, other times, the _Chop Moved_ card will sit there and will never be clued. As the game progresses towards the end, the player with the _Chop Moved_ card will learn more and more information about it. For example, they might accumulate a lot of negative clues on the card. Or, they might deduce that it is probably not any of the cards that are already played (which drastically reduces the possibilities towards the end of the game).
- A clever player who accumulates enough information about a _Chop Moved_ card may determine that all of the possibilities for the card are playable. In this situation, they do not have to wait for their teammates to clue the card directly - they can simply blind-play the _Chop Moved_ card and it will work, regardless of which exact card it is.
- Blind-playing cards in this manner is risky! It is fairly common for players to forgo cluing _Chop Moved_ cards directly in favor of using the other copy of the card in someone else's hand. (For example, it may be more efficient to use the non-_Chop Moved_ copy if it would be a 2-for-1 clue instead of a 1-for-1 clue.) Thus, there is always the chance that blind-playing a _Chop Moved_ card in this manner will get a strike for the team (in the case where the other copy was used or in the case where the _Chop Move_ was a mistake).
- For this reason, clever players should try to blind-play their _Chop Moved_ cards if they have a pretty good chance of being playable, but **only if the team has one or more strikes to spare**.
- Subsequently, players should **not** clue a now-useless _Chop Moved_ card to prevent a future strike. The typical strategy is to just let it be _Chop Moved_ for the rest of the game:
  - In the best case scenario, the _Chop Moved_ player will naturally figure out that the card is trash and can safely discard it. Or, alternatively, they will keep the card _Chop Moved_, but continue to discard other useless cards from their chop until the end of the game.
  - In the worst case scenario, the _Chop Moved_ player will try to blind-play the card and get a strike for the team. But this is not guaranteed, and even if they do, they will only do it if there is a strike to spare.
