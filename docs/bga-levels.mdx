# Welcoming Board Game Arena Players / <span className="highlight">Holy Hell</span>

<br />

## Introduction

This page is written for people who have a bunch of games on [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/) and may be interested in playing some games with the _H-Group_ on [Hanab Live](https://www.hanab.live). This page is meant to help you assess your current level and guide you along your path of many (generic brand) fireworks.

It is also for current H-Group members to get a sense of what level BGA players are actually playing at, because we know that you don't know either.

### Zamiel's (James') Guide For BGA players

It is highly recommended that you read [Zamiel's guide](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/BGA.md).

<br />

## "What level am I?"

H-Group has a level system but NOT an ELO system. (Levels are for learning, not earning.) Players self assess their current knowledge according to the [learning path](learning-path.mdx#level-summary) and all players at the table are expected to play to the lowest level. Games are followed by a co-operative full game review in a Discord voice call. Beginners are met with patience. The levels help adjust expectations of all players, allow us to co-operate, and let us learn many complexities at a comfortable pace.

Whilst levels are not the focus of playing and learning this game, _playing to our level is good etiquette and helps us learn good._

It is difficult to assess your level as a BGA player. Many of you have years of experience. BGA and H-Group have a sharing relationship and have adopted and adapted many things from one another. Many conventions are the same, many are new, many have tiny differences only detectable via bomb. The order in which you have learnt conventions will be different. You will instinctively think a [Level 1 Save Clue](level-1.mdx#the-2-save) to a 2 on chop is a long layered finesse. Learning new conventions might be relatively easy compared to breaking old habits.

A new convention might be hard, but it is worthwhile.

### <span className="highlight">Holy Knowledge</span>

There are 23 basic levels. Most experienced BGA players will begin comfortably at Level 14 - but with holes in their knowledge. We call this _Holy Knowledge_. To guide you we have modified the standard [learning path](learning-path.mdx#level-summary) below. The "holes" that we feel are most common are coloured in <span className="highlight">yellow</span>.

_(Please let us know on Discord if these holes have holes.)_

## How to fill the <span className="highlight">holes</span>...

### Option 1: Begin At The Beginning

Start at Level 1 like everyone else! H-Group is more used to people traversing the levels linearly. You will still patch the holes, with far less reading!

### Option 2: Begin Low

You may begin at whatever level from 1-14 that you are comfortable with and that isn't frustrating for other players. You must have at least read through each level and feel you reasonably understand it before attempting it.

You may sit at a normal table and tell them that you are from BGA and which level you wish to try. (e.g. "BGA 6" = experienced BGA H-n00b with expected holes.) You may link the table above as it will be helpful for them too.

On [The Hanab Discord Server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp) there are people willing to play a Holy game with you - just ask!

If you start too high, players might suggest that it is better to focus on lower levels first. Starting lower also means less reading!

We recommend starting at Level 6 and giving special care and attention to chop focus before moving on.

### Option 3: The Holy Level

The "Holy Level" is a _special level_ where everything up to Level 14 is permitted, yet players understand that some (or all) players are still working to patch the above holes. To play at Holy Level you must

- be an experienced BGA player
- have success with all "un-holy" conventions listed above
- have read the guide from Level 1-14

You may, for example, wish to give special focus to Level 6 and Level 8 for a few games before moving to The Holy Level.

<br />

### Remember...

... don't rush! Keep a pace that is comfortable. <span className="highlight">This is a game of patience and quiet joy.</span>

<br />

## After the holes...

Once you have filled all holes to Level 14 you will have integrated conventions and can proceed more comfortably with the standard Learning Path.

<br />
