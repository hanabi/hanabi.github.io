# Welcoming Board Game Arena Players / <span className="highlight">Holy Hell</span>

<br />

## Introduction

This page is written for people who have a bunch of games on [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/) and may be interested in playing some games with the _H-Group_ on [Hanab Live](https://www.hanab.live). This page is meant to help you assess your current level and guide you along your path of many (generic brand) fireworks.

It is also for current H-Group members to get a sense of what level BGA players are actually playing at, because we know that you don't know either.

### Zamiel's (James') Guide For BGA players

It is highly recommended that you read [Zamiel's guide](https://github.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/blob/main/misc/BGA.md).

<br />

## What are Levels?

H-Group has a level system but __not__ an ELO system. (Levels are for learning, not earning.) Players self assess their current knowledge according to the [learning path](learning-path.mdx#level-summary) and all players at the table are expected to play to the lowest level. Games are followed by a cooperative full game review in a Discord voice call. Beginners are met with patience. The levels help adjust expectations of all players, allow us to co-operate, and let us learn many complexities at a comfortable pace.

<br />

## What Level Am I?

While levels are not the focus of playing and learning this game, playing at an appropriate level is good etiquette and helps people learn more efficiently. As a former BGA player it may be difficult to assess your level, especially if you have a year or more of prior experience. This is because you will likely know some of the higher conventions (like *Bluffs*, which is a level 10 convention) while not completely knowing all of the lower level conventions (like *Chop Focus*, which is a level 1 convention, or *Double Discard Avoidance*, which is a level 8 convention).

### <span className="highlight">Holy Knowledge</span>

The H-Group learning path has 23 levels. Most experienced BGA players will begin comfortably at level 14... but with many holes in their knowledge. We call this _Holy Knowledge_. To guide you we have modified the standard [learning path](learning-path.mdx#level-summary) below. The "holes" that we feel are most common are coloured in <span className="highlight">yellow</span>.

## How to fill the <span className="highlight">holes</span>...

### Option 1: Begin At The Beginning

Start at Level 1 like everyone else! H-Group is more used to people traversing the levels linearly. You will still patch the holes, with far less reading!

### Option 2: Begin Low

You may begin at whatever level from 1-14 that you are comfortable with and that isn't frustrating for other players. You must have at least read through each level and feel you reasonably understand it before attempting it.

You may sit at a normal table and tell them that you are from BGA and which level you wish to try. (e.g. "BGA 6" = experienced BGA H-n00b with expected holes.) You may link the table above as it will be helpful for them too.

On [The Hanab Discord Server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp) there are people willing to play a Holy game with you - just ask!

If you start too high, players might suggest that it is better to focus on lower levels first. Starting lower also means less reading!

We recommend starting at Level 6 and giving special care and attention to chop focus before moving on.

### Option 3: The Holy Level

The "Holy Level" is a _special level_ where everything up to Level 14 is permitted, yet players understand that some (or all) players are still working to patch the above holes. To play at Holy Level you must

- be an experienced BGA player
- have success with all "un-holy" conventions listed above
- have read the guide from Level 1-14

You may, for example, wish to give special focus to Level 6 and Level 8 for a few games before moving to The Holy Level.

<br />

### Remember...

... don't rush! Keep a pace that is comfortable. <span className="highlight">This is a game of patience and quiet joy.</span>

<br />

## After the Holes...

Once you have filled all holes to level 14, you can proceed more comfortably with the standard Learning Path.

Thank you so much for taking the time to play with the _H-Group_!
