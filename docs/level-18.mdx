## Conventions

<br />

### Elimination & Elimination Notes

- Normally, your teammates would never let you discard anything important. So when you discard some playable card (or a needed 2) **and** that card is not in anyone else's hand, you might think that the team made a mistake.
- From _High Value Principle_, you should never assume your teammates are making a mistake. One excellent reason that they would let you discard an important card is that you have the other copy in your hand. (In order to satisfy _Good Touch Principle_, they had to wait for you to discard it so that they would not duplicate the card.)
- Thus, when you get a follow-up clue, you will know exactly what card it is.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice discards her chop (slot 5). It is a (playable) red 4.
  - Alice gasps in surprise - she knows that everyone on the team agrees to not let each other discard playable cards (_Save Principle_).
  - Alice knows that the team was not in a dire situation or anything, so the only explanation is that she must have the other copy of the red 4.
  - Alice writes a note of "r4?" on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5. (It can't be on slot 1, since that is the card she just drew.)
  - Bob clues Alice red, which touches a card on slot 1 and slot 2.
  - Normally, Alice would play the left-most card (slot 1) as the red 4. However, because of her notes, she knows that the red 4 must actually be on slot 2.
  - Alice successfully plays red 4 from slot 2. Since the red 5 is the only good red card left, Alice can assume that her other red card is red 5 (from _Good Touch Principle_), and she can play it on the next turn.

<EliminationNotes />

- In this example, the "r4?" notes that Alice writes are called _Elimination Notes_. _Elimination Notes_ are notes that represent the possible slots for a specific card.
- In this example, the "thing" that triggered the writing of _Elimination Notes_ was the discarding of a card, so this is called _Discard Elimination_.
- Note that players should not always make _Elimination Notes_ when they discard a playable card. In some cases, games can be extremely busy, leaving no reasonable way to get the playable card. Players must use their best judgment and account for this.

<br />

### Double Discard Elimination

- When a player who is in a _Double Discard_ situation discards anyway with an obvious clue to give (such as a _5 Stall_), it implies that they **see** the other copy of the card, and were not _Double Discarding_ at all.
- Thus, when this occurs, you should write _Elimination Notes_ on your entire hand for that card.
- This is almost exactly the same thing as _Discard Elimination_, except it is triggered by the discard of a separate player.

### 2 Elimination

- According to _Save Principle_, everyone knows that all of the 2's must get saved. Thus, if someone else on the team lets a 2 get discarded, that is very strange.
- If there is not anything special going on, then this should be a signal that someone else has the other copy of the 2, and should trigger the writing of _Elimination Notes_ on their hand.

<br />

## Special Moves

<br />

### The Elimination Blind-Play

- First, see the section on [Elimination](#elimination--elimination-notes).
- In the example for _Discard Elimination_, the team clued the second copy of the red 4 directly. But in other situations, the team will **not** need to clue anything. The player with the _Elimination Notes_ can eliminate the possibilities one by one. When there is only one possibility left, they can blind-play the card as an _Elimination Blind-Play_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice discards her chop (slot 5). It is a (playable) red 4.
  - Alice knows that the team was not in a dire situation or anything, so the only explanation is that she must have the other copy of the red 4.
  - Alice writes "r4?" _Elimination Notes_ on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5. (It can't be on slot 1, since that is the card she just drew.)
  - Bob clues Alice blue, which touches slots 1, 2, 3, and 4. (This is a _Play Clue_ on slot 1.)
  - Alice writes a note of "blue 1" on slot 1.
  - Alice erases her _Elimination Notes_ for the red 4 from slots 2, 3, and 4.
  - The only card left with an _Elimination Note_ is slot 5.
  - Alice can now blind-play the red 4 when it gets to her turn as an _Elimination Blind-Play_.

<EliminationBlindPlay />

### The Elimination Play Clue

- A clue that touches multiple cards only has one focus. As you probably know, if the chop card was not touched, then the focus is the left-most card.
- However, this rule does not apply if a clue singles out a playable card from _Elimination_. In this case, the card is only focused on the _Elimination_ card, and any other cards touched are not necessarily playable right now.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice has both red 2's in her hand on slot 2 and slot 5. (Alice's chop is her slot 5.)
  - Alice discards her chop, and it is revealed to be the red 2.
  - Alice is surprised, and writes _Discard Elimination Notes_ for red 2 on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  - Bob gives a number 2 clue to Alice that touches a card in slot 1, slot 3 and slot 4.
  - Normally, Alice would treat this as a _Play Clue_ on the 2 in her slot 1. However, she knows from her elimination notes that this is not the red 2, so the focus of the clue moves to the right. Therefore, slot 3 is exactly red 2 (and she can play it right now).
  - Alice knows that the point of the clue was only to get the red 2. Her cards in slots 1 and 4 can be any 2's in the game and are not necessarily playable right now.

<EliminationPlayClue />

### Interaction Between Elimination & Chop-Focus

- Sometimes, players will have two or more _Elimination Notes_ on cards in their hand. These players can be given follow-up clues that single out the identity of the _Elimination_ card.
- Clues can single out the _Elimination_ card using _positive information_ or by using _negative information_.

#### Example of an Elimination Single-Out Using a Clue With Positive Information

- See the section on the _[Elimination Play Clue](#the-elimination-play-clue)_:
  - In the example for _Elimination Play Clue_, Alice receives a 2 clue.
  - After getting the 2 clue, Alice deletes the _Elimination Notes_ on her slot 2, slot 4, and slot 5.
  - Thus, Alice has completely narrowed down the identity of the red 2 to be in slot 3.

#### Example of an Elimination Single-Out Using a Clue With Negative Information

- For example, in 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice discards red 2. She writes _Elimination Notes_ for red 2 on slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.
  - Bob clues number 3 to Alice, touching three 3's on slot 2, slot 3, and slot 4.
  - After getting the number 3 clue, Alice deletes the _Elimination Notes_ on her slot 2, slot 3, and slot 4.
  - Thus, Alice has completely narrowed down the identity of the red 2 to be in slot 5.

#### Chop-Focus Happens **Before** Clues Are Given

- When a clue is given that singles out an _Elimination_ card with _negative information_, then the focus of the clue should be evaluated normally.
- In other words, the focused slot should be evaluated **before** the clue was given, just like how every other clue works.
- For example, continuing on from the previous example:
  - Alice also knows that Bob's number 3 clue must be a _Play Clue_ on the red 3 (since red 1 is on the only 1 currently played and there are no 3's in the trash).
  - But which slot is Bob's clue focusing? In other words, which slot is promised to be red 3?
  - The clue is either focused on slot 2 (the newest of the clued cards) or slot 4 (the "new" chop after the red 2 is accounted for).
  - Alice knows that you evaluate where the chop is **before** clues are given, so the clue must be focused on slot 2.

### The Elimination Riding Deduction

- If:
  - there are only two cards left in a player's hand with _Elimination Notes_ **and**
  - the previous players let the chop card ride **and**
  - the previous players were not busy, **then**
- The card with the _Elimination Note_ card cannot be on the chop! (Otherwise, one of the previous players would have clued it with either a _Play Clue_ or a _Save Clue_ in order to prevent it from being discarded.)
- In such a situation, the player with the _Elimination Notes_ can "jump ahead" and immediately blind-play the newest of the two cards.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 has been played on the red stack.
  - Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice discards her chop (slot 5). It is a (playable) red 2.
  - Alice knows that the team was not busy, so she must have the other copy of red 2.
  - Alice writes _Elimination Notes_ on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  - Alice receives no clues on the next go-around of the table. She discards, and now has _Elimination Notes_ on slots 3, 4, and 5.
  - Alice receives no clues on the next go-around of the table. She discards, and now has _Elimination Notes_ on slots 4 and 5.
  - Alice receives no clues on the next go-around of the table. Her teammates would not let the other copy of red 2 be discarded, so it must be on slot 4. Alice blind-plays red 2 from slot 4.

### The Riding Bluff

- Typically, when a player has two cards with _Elimination Notes_ and the "true" copy of the card is on chop, you must clue it to let them know.
- However, if the other card is also playable, you can choose to not clue anything.
- Next, the player should perform an _Elimination Riding Deduction_, and play the unrelated card.
- After that, there will be only one card left with an _Elimination Note_, so they will go on to play the "true" card on their next turn.

<br />

### The Elimination Self-Chop Move

- Sometimes, a player will have narrowed down their _Elimination Notes_ to one specific card. Thus, even if the card happens to have no positive clues on it, the player will know the exact identity of the card.
- In this situation, the player should _Self-Chop Move_ the card. In other words, since the _Elimination Notes_ were globally known, there is no need for someone on the team to waste a clue to prevent the discard of the card.

<br />

### The Elimination Finesse

- Normally, if a player is _Finessed_, they are supposed to play their _Finesse Position_ card. However, what if they have _Elimination Notes_ on their hand for the specific card that is _Finessed_?
- In most situations, there will not be an _Elimination Note_ on slot 1 (e.g. the _Finesse Position_). This means that playing slot 1 into the _Finesse_ would not make any sense.
  - However, in the rare case where there is an _Elimination Note_ on their _Finesse Position_, then the player should **still** not play the _Finesse Position_; read on.
- Here, the player is expected to play the **oldest** of the cards with the _Elimination Notes_ on them (not counting _Chop Moved_ cards, if any).
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Blue 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice discards a blue 3. Blue 3 was playable, and nothing urgent is currently happening, so she writes _Elimination Notes_ on her hand for the other blue 3 on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  - Bob clues Cathy blue, which touches a blue 4 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Alice knows that this is some sort of _Reverse Finesse_, as it is calling for the blue 3. However, the blue 3 cannot be in her _Finesse Position_ (slot 1), as she knows from the _Elimination Notes_ that it must be either on slot 2, 3, 4, or 5. So it must instead be a _Reverse Elimination Finesse_.
  - The _Elimination Finesse_ promises that it is her oldest card, so she plays slot 5 as blue 3.

<EliminationFinesse />

- As mentioned above, _Chop Moved_ cards should be skipped over when finding the _Elimination Finesse_ target. If there are two or more cards with _Elimination Notes_ on them and they are all _Chop Moved_, then the oldest _Chop Moved_ card should be played.
- _Elimination Finesses_ apply to **all** types of situations with _Elimination Notes_ (including _Double Discard Elimination Notes_). Subsequently, you can more specifically describe an _Elimination Finesse_ as a _Discard Elimination Finesse_ or a _Double Discard Elimination Finesse_.
- Note that normal _Finesses_ take priority over _Self-Elimination Finesses_. For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice's hand is completely unclued. Alice has _Elimination Notes_ on slot 3 and slot 4 for red 3.
  - Cathy clues a number 4 in Alice's slot 1 as a _Self-Finesse_.
  - If Alice's 4 is a blue 4, then this would be a normal _Self-Finesse_, and Alice should blind-play blue 3 from slot 2.
  - If Alice's 4 is a red 4, then this would be an _Elimination Self-Finesse_, and Alice should blind-play red 3 from slot 4.
  - Alice knows that in this situation, you always supposed to assume a normal _Finesse_, so she blind-plays blue 3 from slot 2.

<EliminationFinesse2 />

### Trash Touch Elimination

- Players carefully choose between using a color clue and a number clue in order to avoid violating _Good Touch Principle_. Sometimes, when both a color clue **and** a number would violate _Good Touch Principle_, players are forced to pick between the lesser of two evils.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: `red 4, red 3, blue 4, blue 4, blue 1`
  - If Alice needs to clue the red 4 **right now** for some reason, she would be screwed. If she clues red, she would duplicate the red 3. If she clues number 4, she would duplicate the blue 4. Both are bad.
  - So, Alice has to choose between the lesser of two evils and chooses to clue number 4 as a _Play Clue_ on the red 4.
  - Bob plays the red 4.
  - Now, Cathy has to interpret what happened. Normally, Alice duplicating the blue 4 would mean that she is making a mistake or something else special is going on. However, in this situation, Cathy knows that Alice had to choose between two evils, so the number 4 clue is considered to be ordinary.
- In some situations, players can see that it **is** possible to use a color or number clue to uniquely touch a clue target without "picking up" extra bad cards. So if a clue is given that does so anyway, it is conveying an extra special message.
- When this occurs, and there is exactly one "missing" card, players should write an _Elimination Note_ in their hand for the missing card. This is called _Trash Touch Elimination_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 and all the other 1s are played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: `red 4, red 1, blue 1, green 1, yellow 1`
  - Alice wants to give a play clue to the red 4. Everyone else on the team (other than Bob) can see that she can give either number 4 or red.
    - If Alice clues number 4, then it will uniquely touch the red 4 (which will satisfy _Good Touch Principle_).
    - If Alice clues red, then it will touch the red 4 and the red 1 (which will **violate** _Good Touch Principle_).
  - Alice clues red to Bob. Since nothing was stopping her from cluing number 4, this is very strange.
  - Bob plays the red 4.
  - There is only one "missing" red card - the red 5. Cathy knows that normally, Bob would think that his red 1 is the red 5 (from _Good Touch Principle_). This must mean that Cathy has the red 5. Cathy writes _Trash Touch Elimination Notes_ on her hand for the red 5.
