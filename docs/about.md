[Hanabi](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi) is a fantastic cooperative card game of logic and reasoning. Our group, started in February 2016 by a guy named Hyphen-ated, and continued by a guy named Zamiel, gets online games going regularly on the [Hanab Live](https://hanab.live) website. Everything doesn't always go perfectly, but we strive to constantly improve. Naturally, we have also built up a set of conventions that we all agree upon at the beginning of the game so that it is easier to understand what everyone else is doing. As the list of conventions got longer, we wanted to make sure that everything was documented in an official capacity.

Are you looking to start playing games with the *H-Group*? Head on over to [the beginner's guide](/docs/beginner).

Have you found your way here from the Internet? That's fine too. Feel free to cherry-pick strategies for your own group, or even adopt the whole convention framework. We enjoy talking to other Hanabi players, so make sure to say hi in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp) as well. (Discord is a voice and text chat application that you can run in a browser.)
