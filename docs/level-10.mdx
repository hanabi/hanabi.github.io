## Special Moves

<br />

### The Gentleman's Discard

- First, see the section on the _[Sarcastic Discard](level-3.mdx#the-sarcastic-discard)_.
- To review, the _Sarcastic Discard_ is:
  1. a move that transfers a **clued card** in one person's hand to a **clued card** in another person's hand
  1. **necessary** to eliminate confusion among the team (because from _Good Touch Principle_, we are not normally supposed to have two copies of the same card "touched" with a clue)
  1. done with both playable cards and non-playable cards
- It is also possible to "transfer" cards to the _Finesse Position_ of other players. This is called a _Gentleman's Discard_ to signify that the other card was completely blind as opposed to having a clue on it already.
- The _Gentleman's Discard_ is:
  1. a move that transfers a **clued card** in one person's hand to the **_Finesse Position_** of another person's hand
  1. **not necessary** and does not directly help the team, but may have some helpful side effects
  1. done with **only playable cards**
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching one 1.
  - Bob clues red to Cathy, filling in the already-touched 1 as red 1, as well as touching a new card, which must be a red 2.
  - Cathy discards the known red 1 as a _Gentleman's Discard_.
  - Alice blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card as red 1.

<GentlemanDiscard />

- Often times, doing a _Gentleman's Discard_ will delay things and cost the team _Tempo_. Thus, a _Gentleman's Discard_ that slows things down is only good if there is some other side benefit to offset the lost _Tempo_ (such as delaying the discard of a valuable card, for example).
- Just like how _Prompts_ take precedence over _Finesses_, _Sarcastic Discards_ take precedence over _Gentleman's Discards_.
- For the purposes of _Priority_, _Gentleman's Discards_ do not count as a blind-play. (_Priority_ is a concept that is introduced in a later level.)
  - This is because the _Gentleman's Discard_ is an information-symmetric move and nothing needs to be "proven" to other members of the team.

<br />

### The Layered Gentleman's Discard

- First, see the section on the _[Gentleman's Discard](#the-gentlemans-discard)_.
- One great reason to want to do a _Gentleman's Discard_ is if the card you are discarding is also behind playable cards. This is similar to a _Layered Finesse_, only it was initiated by a discard instead of a clue.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching one 1.
  - Bob clues red to Cathy, filling in the already-touched 1 as red 1, as well as touching a new card, which must be red 2.
  - Cathy discards the known red 1 as a _Gentleman's Discard_.
  - Alice blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card as red 1, but it is green 1.
  - Alice knows that she is promised the red 1, so she will blind-play her slot 2 on her next turn.

<LayeredGentlemanDiscard />

<br />

### The Baton Discard

- First, see the section on the _[Gentleman's Discard](#the-gentlemans-discard)_.
- When a _Gentleman's Discard_ happens, it transfers a playable card to someone else's hand. But players are also allowed to transfer unplayable cards that they happen to know the full identity of. We call this a _Baton Discard_ to distinguish it from the more-ordinary _Gentleman's Discard_.
- Just like a _Gentleman's Discard_, a _Baton Discard_ promises that the card is exactly on someone else's _Finesse Position_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice discards a known red 3.
  - Bob does not have any clued cards in his hand.
  - Bob looks at Cathy's hand and does not see the red 3. Thus, he knows that he has it.
  - Bob marks his _Finesse Position_ card as red 3. For now, Bob does not have anything else to do, so he discards his chop card.

<BatonDiscard />

- Similar to the _Gentleman's Discard_, the transferred card counts as being clued. (All players should write a note of "cm" on the transferred card.)
  - Subsequently, this means that the player's _Finesse Position_ will shift to the right by one slot.
- Note that it is **illegal** to perform a _Layered Baton Discard_; the card **must** be exactly on _Finesse Position_.
  - This is because a _Layered Baton Discard_ would be information asymmetric. Since the card is not playable yet, the layer would not unravel in a defined time frame. In other words, if the card does not become playable for a long time, the player could technically discard the card without knowing that it was inside of a layer.
  - For level 24 players, a _Layered Baton Discard_ would instead be interpreted as a _[Blaze Discard](level-24.mdx#the-blaze-discard)_.
- _Baton Discards_ are mostly useful for two main reasons:
  1. To better satisfy _Team Distribution Principle_. It makes sense to transfer a card out of a locked / almost locked hand to a player with an "empty" hand or a hand that only has one card clued in it.
  1. You want to protect your own chop. If you discard your chop, the team could be losing some high-value _one-away-from-playable_ card. But if you transfer a card to someone else, it gives you something "safe" to do.

### The Sarcastic Finesse

- First, see the section on the _[Sarcastic Discard](level-3.mdx#the-sarcastic-discard)_.
- Imagine that in a 3-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice has an already-clued 2 in her hand. She has no idea what color 2 it is.
  - Alice initiates a _Finesse_ by giving a red color _Play Clue_ to a red 2 in Cathy's hand.
  - Bob blind-plays the red 1 from his _Finesse Position_.
  - In most cases, Cathy would now play the red 2.
  - However, in this case, Alice's unknown 2 actually happens to be a red 2. In this situation, Cathy is expected to perform a _Sarcastic Discard_.

<SarcasticFinesse />

- Doing a _Finesse_ that potentially duplicates a card in this way is called a _Sarcastic Finesse_. Normally, potentially duplicating a card is bad - it violates _Good Touch Principle_ and could lead to a clue being wasted. However, potentially duplicating a card with the _Sarcastic Finesse_ is not bad because:
  - In the best case, you get a "true" _Finesse_ (a 2-for-1 or better).
  - In the worst case, you get a 1-for-1 and full knowledge on a clued card in your own hand that was previously a mystery.
  - On average, this is a 1.5-for-1, which satisfies _Minimum Clue Value Principle_.

<br />

### The Certain Finesse & The Certain Discard

- First, see the section on the _[Sarcastic Finesse](#the-sarcastic-finesse)_.
- Imagine that in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice has an already-clued red card in her hand. It has a negative 4 clue on it, so from _Good Touch Principle_ Alice knows that it is either red 3 or red 5.
  - Alice performs a _Reverse Finesse_ by giving a red color _Play Clue_ to a red 4 in Bob's hand.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy knows that she is promised the red 3 in her _Finesse Position_.

<CertainFinesseDiscard />

- This is an example of a _Certain Finesse_ - it is similar to the _Sarcastic Finesse_, but the "blind" card was potentially duplicated instead of the clued card.
- In this situation, if Alice really has the red 3, Cathy is allowed to blind-discard their _Finesse Position_ card. This is called a _Certain Discard_, because Cathy can be certain that it is exactly red 3.
- In other words, everyone agrees that performing a _Layered Finesse_ on a card that could potentially be clued in your own hand is illegal. Thus, everyone can be certain that they can safely blind-discard a card to pass it back to someone who potentially duplicated.
- Note that players are **only allowed** to do a _Certain Discard_ if they know they have not been _Bluffed_. This means that _Certain Finesses_ **cannot be performed** from _Bluff Seat_. (_Bluffs_ are an advanced kind of move that is covered later on.)

<br />

### The Composition Finesse

- First, see the section on the _[Sarcastic Finesse](#the-sarcastic-finesse)_ and the _[Certain Finesse](#the-certain-finesse--the-certain-discard)_.
- Sometimes, a move can be both a _Sarcastic Finesse_ and a _Certain Finesse_ at the same time. When this occurs, it is called a _Composition Finesse_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a card in her hand with a red clue on it. From _Good Touch Principle_, it could be either red 3, red 4, or red 5.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, touching a red 4 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy knows that she has the red 3 on her _Finesse Position_ (as a _Certain Finesse_). She can _Certain Discard_ it if Alice has the red 3. But Alice does not have the red 3, so Cathy blind-plays the red 3.
  - Alice discards.
  - Bob knows that his red card is a red 4 (as a _Sarcastic Finesse_). He can _Sarcastic Discard_ it if Alice has the red 4. But Alice does not have the red 4, so Bob plays the red 4.

## Common Mistakes

<br />

### The Double Gentleman's Discard (Illegal)

- Normally, when a player performs a _Gentleman's Discard_, they know the **exact** identity of the card that they are discarding.
- However, sometimes a _Gentleman's Discard_ can occur where, from your perspective, the card could have been two different things. Does this mean that the _Gentleman's Discard_ "gets" **both** of the cards?
- No, it does not. Even if it looks like the player could not have known the true identity of the card, the _Gentleman's Discard_ only gets the specific other matching card. (The reason for this is that it allows players to act upon asymmetric information.)
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Bob number 2, which touches a red 2 on slot 1. This is a _Play Clue_ on the 2. Thus, this is a globally known red 2 or blue 2. Alice right-clicks on the card and writes a note of "r2, b2".
  - Bob also writes a note of "r2, b2", but then stops to think a little deeper. He notices that Alice has a blue 3 in her hand, so it might have been possible for Cathy to perform a _Finesse_ on a hypothetical blue 2 in his hand.
  - Bob rewinds to the beginning of the game and looks through all of the turns, watching closely to see if Cathy had an ample opportunity to perform a _Finesse_ on a blue 2. Indeed, he finds that Cathy had one or two turns where she could have easily performed a _Reverse Finesse_, but discarded instead.
  - Thus, Bob knows that his card must be a red 2, so he updates his "r2, b2" note to "r2".
  - Bob sees that Cathy has a red 2 on her _Finesse Position_, so he performs a _Gentleman's Discard_ by discarding the red 2.
  - Cathy blind-plays the red 2 from her _Finesse Position_.
  - Alice gasps in surprise, because Bob could not have possibly known that it was exactly a red 2. This must be a _Double Gentleman's Discard_, calling for both red 2 and blue 2. Alice blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card, hoping to play a blue 2, but instead plays a red 5, losing the game.
  - Alice forgot that _Double Gentleman's Discards_ were expressly illegal because it is possible for players to have asymmetric information about the current game state.
