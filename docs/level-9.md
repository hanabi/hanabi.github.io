## Special Moves

<br />

### The Gentleman's Discard

- First, see the section on the *[Sarcastic Discard](level-3.md#the-sarcastic-discard)*.
- To review, the *Sarcastic Discard* is:
  1. a move that transfers a **clued card** in one person's hand to a **clued card** in another person's hand
  1. **necessary** to eliminate confusion among the team (because from *Good Touch Principle*, we are not normally supposed to have two copies of the same card "touched" with a clue)
  1. done with both playable cards and non-playable cards
- It is also possible to "transfer" cards to the *Finesse Position* of other players. This is called a *Gentleman's Discard* to signify that the other card was completely blind as opposed to having a clue on it already.
- The *Gentleman's Discard* is:
  1. a move that transfers a **clued card** in one person's hand to the ***Finesse Position*** of another person's hand
  1. **not necessary** and does not directly help the team, but may have some helpful side effects
  1. done with **only playable cards**
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching one 1.
  - Bob clues red to Cathy, filling in the already-touched 1 as red 1, as well as touching a new card, which must be a red 2.
  - Cathy discards the known red 1 as a *Gentleman's Discard*.
  - Alice blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as red 1.

<GentlemanDiscard />

- Often times, doing a *Gentleman's Discard* will delay things and cost the team *Tempo*. Thus, a *Gentleman's Discard* that slows things down is only good if there is some other side benefit to offset the lost *Tempo* (such as delaying the discard of a valuable card, for example).
- Just like how *Prompts* take precedence over *Finesses*, *Sarcastic Discards* take precedence over *Gentleman's Discards*.
- For the purposes of *Priority*, *Gentleman's Discards* do not count as a blind-play. (*Priority* is a concept that is introduced in a later level.)
  - This is because the *Gentleman's Discard* is an information-symmetric move and nothing needs to be "proven" to other members of the team.

<br />

### The Layered Gentleman's Discard

- First, see the section on the *[Gentleman's Discard](#the-gentlemans-discard)*.
- One great reason to want to do a *Gentleman's Discard* is if the card you are discarding is also behind playable cards. This is similar to a *Layered Finesse*, only it was initiated by a discard instead of a clue.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching one 1.
  - Bob clues red to Cathy, filling in the already-touched 1 as red 1, as well as touching a new card, which must be red 2.
  - Cathy discards the known red 1 as a *Gentleman's Discard*.
  - Alice blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as red 1, but it is green 1.
  - Alice knows that she is promised the red 1, so she will blind-play her slot 2 on her next turn.

<LayeredGentlemanDiscard />

<br />

### The Baton Discard

- First, see the section on the *[Gentleman's Discard](#the-gentlemans-discard)*.
- When a *Gentleman's Discard* happens, it transfers a playable card to someone else's hand. But players are also allowed to transfer unplayable cards that they happen to know the full identity of. We call this a *Baton Discard* to distinguish it from the more-ordinary *Gentleman's Discard*.
- Just like a *Gentleman's Discard*, a *Baton Discard* promises that the card is exactly on someone else's *Finesse Position*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice discards a known red 3.
  - Bob does not have any clued cards in his hand.
  - Bob looks at Cathy's hand and does not see the red 3. Thus, he knows that he has it.
  - Bob marks his *Finesse Position* card as red 3. For now, Bob does not have anything else to do, so he discards his chop card.

<BatonDiscard />

- Note that it is **illegal** to perform a *Layered Baton Discard*; the card **must** be exactly on *Finesse Position*.
- *Baton Discards* are mostly useful for two main reasons:
  1. To better satisfy *Team Distribution Principle*. It makes sense to transfer a card out of a locked / almost locked hand to a player with an "empty" hand or a hand that only has one card clued in it.
  1. You want to protect your own chop. If you discard your chop, the team could be losing some high-value *one-away-from-playable* card. But if you transfer a card to someone else, it gives you something "safe" to do.

<br />

### The Sarcastic Finesse

- First, see the section on the *[Sarcastic Discard](level-3.md#the-sarcastic-discard)*.
- Imagine that in a 4-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice has an already-clued 2 in her hand. She has no idea what color 2 it is.
  - Alice initiates a *Finesse* by giving a red color *Play Clue* to a red 2 in Cathy's hand.
  - Bob blind-plays the red 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  - In most cases, Cathy would now play the red 2.
  - However, in this case, Alice's unknown 2 actually happens to be a red 2. In this situation, Cathy is expected to perform a *Sarcastic Discard*.

<SarcasticFinesse />

- Doing a *Finesse* that potentially duplicates a card in this way is called a *Sarcastic Finesse*. Normally, potentially duplicating a card is bad - it violates *Good Touch Principle* and could lead to a clue being wasted. However, potentially duplicating a card with the *Sarcastic Finesse* is not bad because:
  - In the best case, you get a "true" *Finesse* (a 2-for-1 or better).
  - In the worst case, you get a 1-for-1 and full knowledge on a clued card in your own hand that was previously a mystery.
  - On average, this is a 1.5-for-1, which satisfies *Minimum Clue Value Principle*.

<br />

### The Certain Finesse & The Certain Discard

- First, see the section on the *[Sarcastic Finesse](#the-sarcastic-finesse)*.
- Imagine that in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice has an already-clued red card in her hand. It has a negative 4 clue on it, so from *Good Touch Principle* Alice knows that it is either red 3 or red 5.
  - Alice performs a *Reverse Finesse* by giving a red color *Play Clue* to a red 4 in Bob's hand.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy knows that she is promised the red 3 in her *Finesse Position*.

<CertainFinesseDiscard />

- This is an example of a *Certain Finesse* - it is similar to the *Sarcastic Finesse*, but the "blind" card was potentially duplicated instead of the clued card.
- In this situation, if Alice really has the red 3, Cathy is allowed to blind-discard their *Finesse Position* card. This is called a *Certain Discard*, because Cathy can be certain that it is exactly red 3.
- In other words, everyone agrees that performing a *Layered Finesse* on a card that could potentially be clued in your own hand is illegal. Thus, everyone can be certain that they can safely blind-discard a card to pass it back to someone who potentially duplicated.
- Note that players are **only allowed** to do a *Certain Discard* if they know they have not been *Bluffed*. This means that *Certain Finesses* **cannot be performed** from *Bluff Seat*. (*Bluffs* are an advanced kind of move that is covered later on.)

<br />

### The Composition Finesse

- First, see the section on the *[Sarcastic Finesse](#the-sarcastic-finesse)* and the *[Certain Finesse](#the-certain-finesse--the-certain-discard)*.
- Sometimes, a move can be both a *Sarcastic Finesse* and a *Certain Finesse* at the same time. When this occurs, it is called a *Composition Finesse*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a card in her hand with a red clue on it. From *Good Touch Principle*, it could be either red 3, red 4, or red 5.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy knows that she has the red 3 on her *Finesse Position* (as a *Certain Finesse*). She can *Certain Discard* it if Alice has the red 3. But Alice does not have the red 3, so Cathy blind-plays the red 3.
  - Alice discards.
  - Bob knows that his red card is a red 4 (as a *Sarcastic Finesse*). He can *Sarcastic Discard* it if Alice has the red 4. But Alice does not have the red 4, so Bob plays the red 4.

## Common Mistakes

<br />

### The Double Gentleman's Discard (Illegal)

- Normally, when a player performs a *Gentleman's Discard*, they know the **exact** identity of the card that they are discarding.
- However, sometimes a *Gentleman's Discard* can occur where, from your perspective, the card could have been two different things. Does this mean that the *Gentleman's Discard* "gets" **both** of the cards?
- No, it does not. Even if it looks like the player could not have known the true identity of the card, the *Gentleman's Discard* only gets the specific other matching card. (The reason for this is that it allows players to act upon asymmetric information.)
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Bob number 2, which touches a red 2 on slot 1. This is a *Play Clue* on the 2. Thus, this is a globally known red 2 or blue 2. Alice right-clicks on the card and writes a note of "r2, b2".
  - Bob also writes a note of "r2, b2", but then stops to think a little deeper. He notices that Alice has a blue 3 in her hand, so it might have been possible for Cathy to perform a *Finesse* on a hypothetical blue 2 in his hand.
  - Bob rewinds to the beginning of the game and looks through all of the turns, watching closely to see if Cathy had an ample opportunity to perform a *Finesse* on a blue 2. Indeed, he finds that Cathy had one or two turns where she could have easily performed a *Reverse Finesse*, but discarded instead.
  - Thus, Bob knows that his card must be a red 2, so he updates his "r2, b2" note to "r2".
  - Bob sees that Cathy has a red 2 on her *Finesse Position*, so he performs a *Gentleman's Discard* by discarding the red 2.
  - Cathy blind-plays the red 2 from her *Finesse Position*.
  - Alice gasps in surprise, because Bob could not have possibly known that it was exactly a red 2. This must be a *Double Gentleman's Discard*, calling for both red 2 and blue 2. Alice blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card, hoping to play a blue 2, but instead plays a red 5, losing the game.
  - Alice forgot that *Double Gentleman's Discards* were expressly illegal because it is possible for players to have asymmetric information about the current game state.
