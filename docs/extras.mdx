- The "extra" strategies are separated from the rest because they do not come up that often. Thus, non-expert players do not have to worry about learning them.
- If an "extra" strategy does come up in a game, players with experience can often figure out what to do on-the-fly. Otherwise, they can quickly learn about them in the post-game review, and then reference the documentation later if they need to refresh their memory.
