### The Unnecessary Trash Push

#### Example 1

- In a 3-player game:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a single 1 on her chop. Since all of the 1's are already played, it is globally known that this must be me kind of *Trash Push*.
  - Bob sees that the pushed card is a red 3. Cathy has no other red cards in her hand, so Alice could have just clued red to Cathy instead of doing a complicated *Trash Push*.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this is an *Unnecessary Trash Push*. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is the blue 3 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that this must be a *Trash Push Finesse* on blue 4. Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card, but it is red 3 instead and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy now knows that since the two cards did not match each other, this must have been an *Unnecessary Trash Push*.

#### Example 2

- It is pianoblook's turn.
- pianoblook can clue red to derekcheah in order to get the red 3 to play. Nothing is "blocking" the clue.
- Instead, pianoblook clues green to derekcheah as a *Trash Push.
- Next, it is derekcheah's turn. derekcheah knows that this is a *Trash Push*, so he blind-plays his slot 1 card. It is a red 3 and it successfully plays.
- Next, it is Animex52's turn. Animex52 sees that this *Trash Push* was *unnecessary*. So, Animex52 blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a white 1 and it successfully plays.

- It is Floriman's turn. Floriman can clue brown to scharkbite in order to perform a *Finesse* on the brown 3 into the brown 4.
- Instead, Floriman clues red to scharkbite as a *Trash Push*.
- Next, it is Kyle's turn. Kyle knows that this is a *Trash Push* and that the *Trash Pushed* card is a one-away-from-playable brown 4. Thus, this must be a *Trash Push Finesse* that is calling for the brown 3.
- Kyle blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a brown 3 and it successfully plays.
- Next, it is scharkbite's turn. scharkbite plays the brown 4.
- Next, it is pianoblook's turn. pianoblook sees that this *Trash Push* was *unnecessary*. So, pianoblook blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a green 4 and it successfully plays.

- It is Dr_Kakashi's turn. Dr_Kakashi can clue blue to Lilliana in order to get the blue 2 to play. Nothing is "blocking" the clue.
- Instead, Dr_Kakashi clues number 1 to kimbifille.
- Next, it is Lilliana's turn. Lilliana knows that kimbifille's perspective, Dr_Kakashi's clue looks like a *Play Clue* on either the red 1, the green 1, or the black 1. kimbifille will go on to misplay the blue 1.
- Thus, Lilliana knows that this is a *Trash Finesse* or *Trash Bluff*. She blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card. It is a blue 2 and it successfully plays.
- Next, it is Kyle's turn. Kyle sees that the *Trash Bluff* was *unnecessary*. He also sees that the *unnecessary* component will be a *Trash Push* instead of a *Chop Move* (since the blue 1 was on kimbifille's chop). Kyle plays his previously known red 1.
- Next, it is kimbifille's turn. kimbifille's also sees that the *Trash Bluff* was *unnecessary*. kimbifille blind-plays her slot 1 card to fulfill the "extra" component of the *Unnecessary Trash Bluff*. It is a red 2 and it successfully plays.

- It is Dr_Kakashi's turn. Dr_Kakashi can clue number 4 to Lilliana in order to get the blue 4 to play. Nothing is "blocking" the clue.
- Instead, Dr_Kakashi clues red to kimbifille.
- Next, it is Lilliana's turn. Lilliana knows that kimbifille's perspective, Dr_Kakashi's clue looks like a *Play Clue* on the red 4. kimbifille will go on to misplay the red 1 as a red 4.
- If Lilliana plays her *Finesse Position* and it successfully plays, then that will not resolve the situation - kimbifille will then go on to think that the red card is red 5, which is not true.
- Thus, Lilliana knows that this must be an *Unknown Trash Discharge*. Lilliana blind-plays her *Third Finesse Position*. It is a blue 4 and it successfully plays.
- Next, it is Kyle's turn. Kyle sees that the *Unknown Trash Discharge* was *unnecessary*. He also sees that the *unnecessary* component will be a *Trash Push* instead of a *Chop Move* (since the red 1 was on kimbifille's chop). Kyle plays his previously known green 4.
- Next, it is kimbifille's turn. kimbifille's also sees that the *Unknown Trash Discharge* was *unnecessary*. kimbifille blind-plays her slot 2 card to fulfill the "extra" component of the *Unnecessary Trash Bluff*. It is a black 1 and it successfully plays.
