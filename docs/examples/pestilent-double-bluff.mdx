The _[Pestilent Double Bluff](../level-15.mdx#the-pestilent-double-bluff-pdb)_ is a level 15 convention.

### Example 1

![Example Screenshot](/img/examples/pestilent-double-bluff.png)

- It is the first turn of the game and Dr_Kakashi starts.
- Imagine that Dr*Kakashi clues number 2 to RaKXeR. That would touch the red 2 as a \_Play Clue*.
- The next player is MasN. From MasN's perspective, this looks like a _Finesse_. MasN knows that he probably has the red 1 on his _Finesse Position_. MasN blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ and it is yellow 1 and successfully plays. MasN now knows that he was _Bluffed_.
- The next player is Kyle. Kyle sees that from RaKXeR's perspective, a _Finesse_ just occurred, and the 2 in RaKXeR's hand is the yellow 2 (to connect to the yellow 1 that was blind-played). This is a problem (because the card really is red 2 and RaKXeR will go on to misplay it).
- Kyle knows that Dr*Kakashi must be trying to communicate something extra. When this kind of thing happens, it is usually a \_Good Touch Bluff*, which means that someone else already has the yellow 2 clued in their hand. However, this is not the case because Dr_Kakashi gave the clue on the first turn of the game and obviously no-one has any clued cards in their hand yet.
- This must be a _Pestilent Double Bluff_. Kyle can "heal" the situation by blind-playing his _Finesse Position_, and this was Dr*Kakashi's intent all along. Kyle blind-plays his \_Finesse Position* and it is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
- From RaKXeR's perspective, Dr*Kakashi's move looked like a \_Finesse* after MasN blind-played the yellow 1. However, after Kyle also blind-played a card, RaKXeR gasped in surprise. Something special must be going on, since a _Finesse_ on the yellow 1 into the yellow 2 would never cause Kyle to blind-play.
- Subsequently, RaKXeR knows that his 2 cannot be the yellow 2. Furthermore, RaKXeR also knows that his 2 cannot be the blue 2, because then MasN would not have blind-played anything.
- Thus, RaKXeR knows that this must be a _Pestilent Double Bluff_ and marks his 2 as either a green 2, a red 2, or a purple 2.

### Example 2

- It is Dr_Kakashi's turn.
- Imagine that Dr*Kakashi clues number 3 to Kyle. That would touch the blue 3 as a \_Play Clue*.
- The next player is Sucubis. He knows that this is a _Finesse_, so he blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card (slot 1) as a blue 2. Instead, it is a black 2 and it successfully plays. Sucubis now knows that he was _Bluffed_.
- The next player is Valetta6789. She knows that something weird has just happened. Since black 2 connects to a number 3 clue, Kyle will think that he has the black 3 (and it will go on to misplay).
- Valetta6789 knows that this must be a _Pestilent Double Bluff_. She blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card (slot 1). It is purple 1 and it successfully plays.
- The next player is Kyle. After the number 3 clue was given and the black 2 blind-played, Kyle thought that his 3 was the black 3 (since 2 connects to 3). However, if it was black 3, then Valetta6789 never would have blind-played. Thus, Kyle knows that his 3 must be some other 3 than black 3, so he marks it as such.

### Example 3

- It is scharkbite's turn.
- Imagine that scharkbite clues number 3 to asaelr. This would touch the black 3 as a _Play Clue_.
- The next player is iamwhoiamhahaha. He knows that this a _Finesse_, so he blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card (slot 3) as black 2. Instead, it is red 2 and it successfully plays. iamwhoiamhahaha now knows that he was _Bluffed_.
- The next player is Romain672. He knows that something weird has just happened. Since red 2 connects to a number 3 clue, asaelr will think that he has the red 3 (and it will go on to misplay).
- However, in this case Romain672 knows that asaelr will **not** think he has the red 3, because scharkbite has both of them in his own hand.
- With that said, scharkbite does not know that he has both of the red 3's in his hand; from scharkbite's perspective, asaelr **will** go on to think that he has red 3.
- Romain672 knows that scharkbite would never intentionally perform such a bad clue - he must be trying to communicate something extra.
- Romain672 knows that this must be a _Pestilent Double Bluff_. He blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card (slot 1). It is purple 2 and it successfully plays.
- The next player is asaelr. After the number 3 clue was given and the red 2 blind-played, asaelr thought that his 3 was the red 3 (since 2 connects to 3). However, if it was red 3, then Romain672 never would have blind-played. Thus, asaelr knows that his 3 must be some other 3 than red 3, so he marks it as such.
