The *[Bad Touch Double Bluff](/level_19/special_bluffs.md#the-bad-touch-double-bluff-for-3s)* is a level 19 convention.

<br />

### Example 1

- It is the first turn of the game and Dr_Kakashi starts.
- Imagine that Dr_Kakashi clues number 3 to RaKXeR. That would touch both green 3's as a *Play Clue*.
- The next player is MasN. Normally, this kind of thing would signal a *3 Bluff*. But since Dr_Kakashi is violating *Good Touch Principle*, MasN knows that something special is going on. This is not an ordinary *3 Bluff*, it is a *Bad Touch Double Bluff* that calls for two separate blind-plays.
- MasN blind-plays his *Finesse Position*. It is a yellow 1 and it successfully plays.
- The next player is Kyle. Just like MasN, Kyle knows that since Dr_Kakashi violated *Good Touch Principle*, something special is going on:
  - If Kyle does nothing, then RaKXeR will assume that a normal *3 Bluff* happened, which would be bad, because the team would have to give a *Fix Clue* later on.
  - Kyle can blind-play his *Finesse Position* to "prove" that something was wrong with the number 3 clue.
- Kyle blind-plays his *Finesse Position*. It is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
- The next player is RaKXeR.
- From RaKXeR's perspective, Dr_Kakashi's move looked like a *3 Bluff* after MasN blind-played the green 1. (*3 Bluffs* are quite common.)
- However, after Kyle **also** blind-played a card, RaKXeR gasped in surprise. Something special must be going on, since a *3 Bluff* would never cause two people to blind-play in a row.
- Subsequently, RaKXeR knows that this must be a *Bad Touch Double Bluff*, since two unrelated cards blind-played in a row. Both of the 3's in RaKXeR's hand must be the same suit (e.g. both copies of blue 3, or both copies of the green 3, or both copies of the yellow 3, etc.).
- The next time RaKXeR needs to discard, he will discard his left-most 3 (from slot 1). After that, RaKXeR will learn what the specific suit of the card is and he will mark the other 3 accordingly.
