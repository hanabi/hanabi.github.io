The [_Self Color Bluff_](../extras/special-bluffs.mdx#self-color-bluffs-1-for-1-form-scb) is an advanced strategy.

### Example 1 (Self Color Bluff)

- See the example image below.
- Alice notices that the yellow 3 on Bob's _Finesse Position_ is playable. She wants to "get" this card.
- Normally, the best way to get it would be with a _Finesse_ or a _Bluff_ (as a 2-for-1). However, Alice cannot see any _Finesse_ or _Bluff_ targets available for her to use.
- Alice could just clue yellow to Bob, getting the yellow 3 directly (as a 1-for-1).
- Instead, Alice gives a red clue to Bob, which touches the red 2. This red 2 already had a number 2 clue on it, so this clue "fills in" the card, turning it into a globally known red 2.
- Bob knows that Alice is not in a stalling situation, and it is not a _Finesse_ on Cathy, which has the purple 5 on her _Finesse Position_.
- So this must be a _Self Color Bluff_, and Bob blind-plays the yellow 3 as a _Known Self-Bluff_.

### Example 2 (Self Color Double Bluff)

- See the example image below.
- Alice clues purple to Bob, which "fills in" the purple 5. (It was already touched by a number 5 clue earlier in the game.)
- Bob knows that Alice is not in a stalling situation, and it is not a _Finesse_ on Cathy, so this must be a _Self Color Bluff_.
- Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ as a _Known Self-Bluff_. It is a yellow 2 and it successfully plays.
- Cathy knows that the purple 5 is _three-away-from-playable_, so Alice must be intending for a _Self Color Double Bluff_ (instead of a single _Bluff_).
- Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card as a _Known Double Bluff_. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
