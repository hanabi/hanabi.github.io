The [_Surreptitious Finesse_](/extras/special-finesses.mdx#the-surreptitious-finesse) is an advanced strategy.

### Example 1

- See the example image below.
- Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a 3 as a _Play Clue_.

<Example1Part1 />

- Bob needs to figure out the meaning of the 3 clue. Donald does not have any playable cards on _Finesse Position_, but Cathy does, so Bob knows that this could be a _Reverse Finesse_ on one of Cathy's cards.
- From Bob's perspective, it could be a few different possibilities:
  - Cathy could be blind-playing 0 cards. In that case, it would be a _Double Self-Finesse_ on Bob for a 1 and a 2, which means that the 3 could be any 3 in the game. (But Bob has to give a chance for Cathy to blind-play first before he should blind-play anything.)
  - Cathy could be blind-playing 1 card. In that case, it would be a _Double Finesse_ and Bob would have the red 2 on his _Finesse Position_, which means that the 3 would be the connecting red 3.
  - Cathy could be blind-playing 2 cards. In that case, it would be a _Layered Finesse_ and Bob would have the purple 2 on his _Finesse Position_, which means that the 3 would be the connecting purple 3.
  - Cathy could be blind-playing 3 cards. In that case, it would be a _Layered Finesse_ and Bob would not have to blind-play anything, which means that the 3 would be the connecting red 3. (Out of all of the possibilities, this is the most likely, since it does not involve Bob blind-playing any cards.)
  - Cathy could be blind-playing 4 cards. In that case, it would be a _Surreptitious Finesse_ and Bob would have the blue 2 on his _Finesse Position_, which means that the 3 would be the connecting blue 3.
- This means that for now, Bob has to wait and see what Cathy does. Bob clues green to Donald as a _Play Clue_ on the green 1.

<Example1Part2 />

- Cathy knows that she has the blue 1 as a _Double Finesse_. She blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card. It is the red 1 and it successfully plays. Cathy now knows that a _Layered Finesse_ is occurring and that she has the blue 1 on her _Second Finesse Position_.
- On Bob's next turn, he is in the same situation as before. He must give Cathy another turn to see if the purple 1 blind-plays or not. Bob does something unrelated, for example _5 Saves_ Donald's 5.
- Cathy blind-plays her _Second Finesse Position_. It is the purple 1 and it successfully plays. Cathy now knows that a _Layered Finesse_ is still occurring and that she has the blue 1 on her _Third Finesse Position_.
- On Bob's next turn, he is (again) in the same situation as before. He must give Cathy another turn to see if the red 2 blind-plays or not. Bob does something unrelated.
- Cathy blind-plays her _Third Finesse Position_. It is the red 2 and it successfully plays. At first, this is confusing for Cathy, because she realizes that "2" connects to "3", and Bob might now think that he has the connecting red 3. However, Cathy knows that a _Surreptitious Finesse_ is occurring and that she has the blue 1 on her _Fourth Finesse Position_.
- On Bob's next turn, he is (again) in the same situation as before. He must give Cathy another turn to see if the blue 1 blind-plays or not. Bob does something unrelated.
- Cathy blind-plays her _Forth Finesse Position_. It is the blue 1 and it successfully plays.
- Bob now knows that a _Surreptitious Finesse_ is occurring and that he needs to blind-play the blue 2 and that the 3 in his hand is the connecting blue 3.
