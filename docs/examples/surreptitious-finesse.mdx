The _[Surreptitious Finesse](/extras/special-finesses.mdx#the-surreptitious-finesse)_ is an advanced strategy.

### Example 1

![Example Screenshot](/img/examples/surreptitious-finesse.png)

- It is the first turn of the game and letical starts.
- letical clues number 3 to Steve, touching the blue 3 as a _Play Clue_.
- The next player is Steve. Steve needs to figure out the meaning of the 3 clue. hanabornoob does not have any playable cards on _Finesse Position_, but Fey does, so Steve knows that this could be a _Reverse Finesse_ on one of Fey's cards.
- From Steve's perspective, it could be a few different possibilities:
  - Fey could be blind-playing 0 cards. In that case, it would be a _Double Self-Finesse_ on Steve for a 1 and a 2, which means that the 3 could be any 3 in the game. (But Steve has to give a chance for Fey to blind-play first before he should blind-play anything.)
  - Fey could be blind-playing 1 card. In that case, it would be a _Double Finesse_ and Steve would have the red 2 on his _Finesse Position_, which means that the 3 would be the connecting red 3.
  - Fey could be blind-playing 2 cards. In that case, it would be a _Layered Finesse_ and Steve would have the purple 2 on his _Finesse Position_, which means that the 3 would be the connecting purple 3.
  - Fey could be blind-playing 3 cards. In that case, it would be a _Layered Finesse_ and Steve would not have to blind-play anything, which means that the 3 would be the connecting red 3. (Out of all of the possibilities, this is the most likely, since it does not involve Steve blind-playing any cards.)
  - Fey could be blind-playing 4 cards. In that case, it would be a _Surreptitious Finesse_ and Steve would have the blue 2 on his _Finesse Position_, which means that the 3 would be the connecting blue 3.
- This means that for now, Steve has to wait and see what Fey does. Steve clues green to hanabornoob as a _Play Clue_ on the green 1.
- The next player is Fey. Fey knows that she has the blue 1 a _Double Finesse_. She blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card. It is the red 1 and it successfully plays. Fey know knows that a _Layered Finesse_ is occurring and that she has the blue 1 on her _Second Finesse Position_.
- On Steve's next turn, he is in the same situation as before. He must give Fey another turn to see if the purple 1 blind-plays or not. Steve does something unrelated.
- Fey blind-plays her _Second Finesse Position_. It is the purple 1 and it successfully plays. Fey know knows that a _Layered Finesse_ is still occurring and that she has the blue 1 on her _Third Finesse Position_.
- On Steve's next turn, he is (again) in the same situation as before. He must give Fey another turn to see if the red 2 blind-plays or not. Steve does something unrelated.
- Fey blind-plays her _Third Finesse Position_. It is the red 2 and it successfully plays. At first, this is confusing for Fey, because she realizes that "2" connects to "3", and Steve might now think that he has the connecting red 3. However, Fey knows that a _Surreptitious Finesse_ is occurring and that she has the blue 1 on her _Forth Finesse Position_.
- On Steve's next turn, he is (again) in the same situation as before. He must give Fey another turn to see if the blue 1 blind-plays or not. Steve does something unrelated.
- Fey blind-plays her _Forth Finesse Position_. It is the blue 1 and it successfully plays.
- Steve now knows that a _Surreptitious Finesse_ is occurring and that he needs to blind-play the blue 2 and that the 3 in his hand is the connecting blue 3.
