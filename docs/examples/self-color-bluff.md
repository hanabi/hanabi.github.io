The *[Self Color Bluff](/extras/special-bluffs.md#self-color-bluffs-scb)* is a level 19 convention.

<br />

### Example 1

![Example Screenshot](/img/examples/self-color-bluff.png)

- It is joelwool's turn.
- joelwool notices that the yellow 3 on Dr_Kakashi's *Finesse Position* is playable. He wants to "get" this card.
- Normally, the best way to get it would be with a *Finesse* or a *Bluff* (as a 2-for-1). However, joelwool sees that there are no *Finesse* or *Bluff* targets available for him to use.
- So, joelwool could just clue yellow to Dr_Kakashi, getting the yellow 3 directly (as a 1-for-1).
- Instead, joelwool gives a red clue to Dr_Kakashi, which touches the red 2. This red 2 already had a number 2 clue on it, so this clue "fills in" the card, turning it into a globally-known red 2.
- Dr_Kakashi knows that joelwool is not in a stalling situation, so this must be a *Self Color Bluff*. Dr_Kakashi blind-plays the yellow 3 as a *Known Bluff*.
