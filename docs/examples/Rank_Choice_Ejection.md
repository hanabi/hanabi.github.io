The *[Rank Choice Ejection](level_19/ejections.md#rank-choice-ejection-with-a-number-2-or-a-number-5)* is a level 19 convention.

<br />

#### Example 1

![Example Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/examples/rank_choice_ejection.png)

- It is IAMJEFF's turn.
- IAMJEFF wants to clue the rainbow 5. He could use either a blue clue or a number 5 clue to do so:
  - A blue clue would be good because it would be a clear *Play Clue* on the card (and would also "fill-in" the blue 5).
  - A number 5 could would be bad because it would be a *Save Clue*. pianoblook would have to account for the fact that the 5 *could* be the red 5, and pianoblook would not be able to play it quite yet.
- IAMJEFF clues number 5 to pianoblook, touching the rainbow 5 on *Chop*.
- Now, it's piper's turn. piper knows that IAMJEFF could have "cleanly" given a blue clue to pianoblook.
- piper knows that IAMJEFF must be trying to send an additional message:
  - If piper does nothing, pianoblook will treat it as a *5 Save*.
  - If piper blind-plays his *Finesse Position*, pianoblook might think it is a *Finesse* or *Bluff* on a muddy rainbow card (which is not true).
- Thus, piper blind-plays his *Second Finessed Position* as a *Rank Choice Ejection*.
