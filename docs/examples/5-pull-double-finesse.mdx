The _[5 Pull Double Finesse](../level-19.mdx#the-5-pull-double-finesse)_ is a level 19 convention.

### Example 1

![Example Screenshot](/img/examples/5-pull-double-finesse.png)

- It is Dr_Kakashi's turn.
- Dr*Kakashi gives a 5 clue to pianoblook, touching two 5s on slot 1 and 2. Since this is a \_Hard Variant*, this clue will always be a _5 Pull_,
- Now, it is piper's turn. piper sees that the pulled card is two-away-from-playable. If piper does nothing, pianoblook will go on to misplay the rainbow 3.
- piper knows that sometimes, when a _5 Pulled_ card is _two-away-from-playable_, it can trigger a _Discharge_ as a _5 Number Discharge_.
- However, piper also sees that IAMJEFF has a rainbow 2 on his _Finesse Position_, which means the rainbow 3 is only a _one-away-from-playable_ card if piper has a rainbow 1 on his _Finesse Position_.
- Finally, piper also knows that _Finesses_ take priority over _5 Number Discharges_ (when you only have to blind-play one card). So, piper blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card (as a _5 Pull Double Finesse_). It is a rainbow 1 and it successfully plays.
- IAMJEFF is expecting this clue to be a _5 Number Discharge_ and he is surprised that piper blind-plays his slot 1 instead of his slot 3. However, this tells IAMJEFF that this must be a _5 Pull Double Finesse_. IAMJEFF blind-plays his _Finesse Position_. It is a rainbow 2 and it successfully plays.
- pianoblook knows that his _5 Pulled_ card must connect to the rainbow 1 and the rainbow 2. pianoblook blind-plays his slot 3 card to complete the _5 Pull Double Finesse_.
