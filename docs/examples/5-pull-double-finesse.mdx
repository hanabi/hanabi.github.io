The [_5 Pull Double Finesse_](../level-19.mdx#the-5-pull-double-finesse) is a level 19 convention.

### Example 1

In a 5-player game with a black suit (which is a _Hard_ variant):

- The blue 1 is played on the stacks.
- Alice clues number 5 to to Donald, touching two 5s on slot 1 and 2. Since this is a _Hard Variant_, this clue will always be a _5 Pull_.
- Now, it is Bob's turn. Bob sees that the pulled card is two-away-from-playable. If Bob does nothing, Donald will go on to misplay the yellow 3.
- Bob knows that sometimes, when a _5 Pulled_ card is _two-away-from-playable_, it can trigger a _Discharge_ as a _5 Number Discharge_.
- However, Bob also sees that Cathy has a yellow 2 on her _Finesse Position_, which means the yellow 3 is only a _one-away-from-playable_ card if Bob has a Bob 1 on his _Finesse Position_.
- Finally, Bob also knows that _Finesses_ take priority over _5 Number Discharges_ (when you only have to blind-play one card). So, Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card (as a _5 Pull Double Finesse_). It is a yellow 1 and it successfully plays.
- Cathy is expecting this clue to be a _5 Number Discharge_ and he is surprised that Bob blind-plays his slot 1 instead of his slot 3. However, this tells Cathy that this must be a _5 Pull Double Finesse_. Cathy blind-plays his _Finesse Position_. It is a yellow 2 and it successfully plays.
- Donald knows that his _5 Pulled_ card must connect to the yellow 1 and the yellow 2. Donald blind-plays his slot 3 card to complete the _5 Pull Double Finesse_.
