The _[Purge Bluff](/extras/special-bluffs.mdx#the-purge-bluff-layered-bluff)_ is an advanced strategy.

### Example 1

- See the example image below.
- Alice clues green to Cathy. This "fills in" green 4, which is a signal to Cathy that the green 4 is playable right now.
- Bob has a 2 in his hand that could be green 2. Thus, Bob interprets the green clue as a _Prompt_ on the green 2 + a _Finesse_ on the green 3.
- Bob plays his slot 4 card as a green 2 and it successfully plays.
- Cathy knows that no-one has the green 3, because she now has negative green on her entire hand.
- Cathy knows that Bob will think that he has the green 3 and will go on to blind-play the blue 2.
  - After playing the blue 2, Bob will assume that a _Layered Finesse_ is occurring, and Bob will go on to blind-play the purple 1.
  - After that, Bob has no more cards that can be the green 3.
- Both Bob and Cathy knows that the _Purge Bluff_ is a 3-player convention, so Alice's clue was legal without anyone having a green 2.
