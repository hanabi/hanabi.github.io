The _[5 Number Discharge](../level-19.mdx#5-number-discharge-5nd)_ is a level 19 convention.

<br />

### Example 1

![Example Screenshot](/img/examples/5-number-discharge.png)

- It is the first turn of the game and Jake_Stiles starts.
- Jake_Stiles clues number 5 to IAMJEFF. That touches the red 5.
- The next player is Libster. Libster can see that this is not a _5 Stall_, since there are many different _Play Clues_ to give. That means that normally, this would be a _5 Pull_.
- However, Libster can also see that the _5 Pulled_ card is the blue 4, which is three-away-from-playable, so that does not make much sense. Libster knows that when a _5 Pull_ is performed on a card that is two-or-more-away-from-playable, it is instead a _5 Number Discharge_.
- Libster blind-plays his _Third Finesse Position_. It is green 1 and it successfully plays.
