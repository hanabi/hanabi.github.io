The [_Self Color Bluff_](../extras/special-bluffs.mdx#self-color-bluffs-1-for-1-form-scb) is an advanced strategy.

### Example 1

![Example Screenshot](/img/examples/self-color-bluff.png)

- It is joelwool's turn.
- joelwool notices that the yellow 3 on Dr*Kakashi's \_Finesse Position* is playable. He wants to "get" this card.
- Normally, the best way to get it would be with a _Finesse_ or a _Bluff_ (as a 2-for-1). However, joelwool sees that there are no _Finesse_ or _Bluff_ targets available for him to use.
- So, joelwool could just clue yellow to Dr_Kakashi, getting the yellow 3 directly (as a 1-for-1).
- Instead, joelwool gives a red clue to Dr_Kakashi, which touches the red 2. This red 2 already had a number 2 clue on it, so this clue "fills in" the card, turning it into a globally-known red 2.
- Dr*Kakashi knows that joelwool is not in a stalling situation, so this must be a \_Self Color Bluff*. Dr*Kakashi blind-plays the yellow 3 as a \_Known Bluff*.
