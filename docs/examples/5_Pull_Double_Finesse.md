- It is Dr_Kakashi's turn.
- Dr_Kakashi gives a 5 clue to pianoblook, touching two 5s on slot 1 and 2. Since this is a *Hard Variant*, this clue will always be a *5 Pull*,
- Now, it is piper's turn. piper sees that the pulled card is two-away-from-playable. If piper does nothing, pianoblook will go on to misplay the rainbow 3.
- piper knows that sometimes, when a *5 Pulled* card is *two-away-from-playable*, it can trigger a *Discharge* as a *5 Number Discharge*.
- However, piper also sees that IAMJEFF has a rainbow 2 on his *Finesse Position*, which means the rainbow 3 is only a *one-away-from-playable* card if piper has a rainbow 1 on his *Finesse Position*.
- Finally, piper also knows that *Finesses* take priority over *5 Number Discharges* (when you only have to blind-play one card). So, piper blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card (as a *5 Pull Double Finesse*). It is a rainbow 1 and it successfully plays.
- IAMJEFF is expecting this clue to be a *5 Number Discharge* and he is surprised that piper blind-plays his slot 1 instead of his slot 3. However, this tells IAMJEFF that this must be a *5 Pull Double Finesse*. IAMJEFF blind-plays his *Finesse Position*. It is a rainbow 2 and it successfully plays.
- pianoblook knows that his *5 Pulled* card must match the rainbow 1 and the rainbow 2. pianoblook blind-plays his slot 3 card to complete the *5 Pull Double Finesse*.
