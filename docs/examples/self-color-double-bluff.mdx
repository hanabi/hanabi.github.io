The _[Self Color Double Bluff](/extras/special-bluffs.mdx#self-color-double-bluff-scdb)_ is an advanced strategy.

### Example 1

![Example Screenshot](/img/examples/self-color-double-bluff.png)

- It is Dr_Kakashi's turn.
- Dr_Kakashi clues black to Kyle, which "fill in" the black 5. (It was already touched by a number 5 clue early on in the game.)
- Kyle knows that Dr*Kakashi is not in a stalling situation, so this must be a \_Self Color Bluff*. Kyle blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ as a _Known Bluff_. It is a yellow 2 and it successfully plays.
- kimbifille knows that the black 5 is _three-away-from-playable_, so Dr*Kakashi must be intending for a \_Self Color Double Bluff* (instead of a single _Bluff_). Kimbifille blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card as a _Known Double Bluff_. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
