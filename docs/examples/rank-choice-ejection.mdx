The _[Rank Choice Ejection](../extras/ejections.mdx#the-rank-choice-ejection-with-a-number-2-or-a-number-5-rce)_ is an advanced strategy.

<br />

### Example 1

![Example Screenshot](/img/examples/rank-choice-ejection.png)

- It is IAMJEFF's turn.
- IAMJEFF wants to clue the rainbow 5. He could use either a blue clue or a number 5 clue to do so:
  - A blue clue would be good because it would be a clear _Play Clue_ on the card (and would also "fill-in" the blue 5).
  - A number 5 could would be bad because it would be a _Save Clue_. pianoblook would have to account for the fact that the 5 _could_ be the red 5, and pianoblook would not be able to play it quite yet.
- IAMJEFF clues number 5 to pianoblook, touching the rainbow 5 on _Chop_.
- Now, it's piper's turn. piper knows that IAMJEFF could have "cleanly" given a blue clue to pianoblook.
- piper knows that IAMJEFF must be trying to send an additional message:
  - If piper does nothing, pianoblook will treat it as a _5 Save_.
  - If piper blind-plays his _Finesse Position_, pianoblook might think it is a _Finesse_ or _Bluff_ on a muddy rainbow card (which is not true).
- Thus, piper blind-plays his _Second Finessed Position_ as a _Rank Choice Ejection_.
