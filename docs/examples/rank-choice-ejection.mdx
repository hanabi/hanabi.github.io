The [_Rank Choice Ejection_](../extras/ejections.mdx#the-rank-choice-ejection-with-a-number-2-or-a-number-5-rce) is an advanced strategy.

### Example 1

In a 3-player rainbow game:

- Yellow 4, green 3 and rainbow 4 are played on the stacks.
- Bob has an unclued yellow 5 on his _Second Finesse Position_.
- Cathy has an unclued rainbow 5 on her slot 4, and a blue 5 previously clued with number 5 on her slot 5.
- Alice wants to clue the rainbow 5 in Cathy's hand. She could use either a color clue or a number 5 clue to do so:
  - A blue clue would be good because it would be a clear _Play Clue_ on the card (and would also "fill-in" the blue 5).
  - A number 5 could would be bad because it would look like a _Save Clue_ on an unplayable 5.
- Alice still chooses to clue number 5 to Cathy, touching the rainbow 5 on _Chop_.
- Now, it's Bob's turn. Bob knows that Alice could have "cleanly" given a blue clue to Cathy.
- Bob knows that Alice must be trying to send an additional message:
  - If Bob does nothing, Cathy will treat it as a _5 Save_.
  - If Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_, Cathy might think it is a _Finesse_ or _Bluff_ on a green 5 (which is not true).
- Thus, Bob blind-plays his _Second Finessed Position_ as a _Rank Choice Ejection_.
- This signals to Cathy that Alice's clue was not a _Save Clue_ after all, but a _Play Clue_ on the yellow or rainbow 5.
