### The Unnecessary Trash Push

#### Example 1

- In a 3-player game:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a single 1 on her chop. Since all of the 1's are already played, it is globally known that this must be me kind of _Trash Push_.
  - Bob sees that the pushed card is a red 3. Cathy has no other red cards in her hand, so Alice could have just clued red to Cathy instead of doing a complicated _Trash Push_.
  - Thus, Bob knows that this is an _Unnecessary Trash Push_. Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card. It is the blue 3 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that this must be a _Trash Push Finesse_ on blue 4. Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card, but it is red 3 instead and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy now knows that since the two cards did not connect to each other, this must have been an _Unnecessary Trash Push_.

#### Example 2

- It is pianoblook's turn.
- pianoblook can clue red to derekcheah in order to get the red 3 to play. Nothing is "blocking" the clue.
- Instead, pianoblook clues green to derekcheah as a \*Trash Push.
- Next, it is derekcheah's turn. derekcheah knows that this is a _Trash Push_, so he blind-plays his slot 1 card. It is a red 3 and it successfully plays.
- Next, it is Animex52's turn. Animex52 sees that this _Trash Push_ was _unnecessary_. So, Animex52 blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card. It is a white 1 and it successfully plays.

- It is Floriman's turn. Floriman can clue brown to scharkbite in order to perform a _Finesse_ on the brown 3 into the brown 4.
- Instead, Floriman clues red to scharkbite as a _Trash Push_.
- Next, it is Kyle's turn. Kyle knows that this is a _Trash Push_ and that the _Trash Pushed_ card is a one-away-from-playable brown 4. Thus, this must be a _Trash Push Finesse_ that is calling for the brown 3.
- Kyle blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card. It is a brown 3 and it successfully plays.
- Next, it is scharkbite's turn. scharkbite plays the brown 4.
- Next, it is pianoblook's turn. pianoblook sees that this _Trash Push_ was _unnecessary_. So, pianoblook blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card. It is a green 4 and it successfully plays.

- It is Dr_Kakashi's turn. Dr_Kakashi can clue blue to Lilliana in order to get the blue 2 to play. Nothing is "blocking" the clue.
- Instead, Dr_Kakashi clues number 1 to kimbifille.
- Next, it is Lilliana's turn. Lilliana knows that kimbifille's perspective, Dr*Kakashi's clue looks like a \_Play Clue* on either the red 1, the green 1, or the black 1. kimbifille will go on to misplay the blue 1.
- Thus, Lilliana knows that this is a _Trash Finesse_ or _Trash Bluff_. She blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card. It is a blue 2 and it successfully plays.
- Next, it is Kyle's turn. Kyle sees that the _Trash Bluff_ was _unnecessary_. He also sees that the _unnecessary_ component will be a _Trash Push_ instead of a _Chop Move_ (since the blue 1 was on kimbifille's chop). Kyle plays his previously known red 1.
- Next, it is kimbifille's turn. kimbifille's also sees that the _Trash Bluff_ was _unnecessary_. kimbifille blind-plays her slot 1 card to fulfill the "extra" component of the _Unnecessary Trash Bluff_. It is a red 2 and it successfully plays.

- It is Dr_Kakashi's turn. Dr_Kakashi can clue number 4 to Lilliana in order to get the blue 4 to play. Nothing is "blocking" the clue.
- Instead, Dr_Kakashi clues red to kimbifille.
- Next, it is Lilliana's turn. Lilliana knows that kimbifille's perspective, Dr*Kakashi's clue looks like a \_Play Clue* on the red 4. kimbifille will go on to misplay the red 1 as a red 4.
- If Lilliana plays her _Finesse Position_ and it successfully plays, then that will not resolve the situation - kimbifille will then go on to think that the red card is red 5, which is not true.
- Thus, Lilliana knows that this must be an _Unknown Trash Discharge_. Lilliana blind-plays her _Third Finesse Position_. It is a blue 4 and it successfully plays.
- Next, it is Kyle's turn. Kyle sees that the _Unknown Trash Discharge_ was _unnecessary_. He also sees that the _unnecessary_ component will be a _Trash Push_ instead of a _Chop Move_ (since the red 1 was on kimbifille's chop). Kyle plays his previously known green 4.
- Next, it is kimbifille's turn. kimbifille's also sees that the _Unknown Trash Discharge_ was _unnecessary_. kimbifille blind-plays her slot 2 card to fulfill the "extra" component of the _Unnecessary Trash Bluff_. It is a black 1 and it successfully plays.
