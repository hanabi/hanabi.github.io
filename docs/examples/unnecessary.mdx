[_Unnecessary Moves_](/level-24.mdx) are a level 24 convention.

### The Unnecessary Trash Push

#### Example 1

- All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
- Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a single 1 on her chop. Since all of the 1's are already played, it is globally known that this must be some kind of _Trash Push_.
- Bob sees that the pushed card is a red 3. Cathy has no other red cards in her hand, so Alice could have just clued red to Cathy instead of doing a complicated _Trash Push_.
- Thus, Bob knows that this is an _Unnecessary Trash Push_. Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card as an _Ignition_. It is the blue 3 and it successfully plays.
- Cathy knows that this must be a _Trash Push Finesse_ on blue 4. Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card, but it is red 3 instead and it successfully plays.
- Cathy now knows that since the two cards did not connect to each other, this must have been an _Unnecessary Trash Push_.

#### Example 2

- See the example image below.
- Alice can clue red to Bob in order to get the red 3 to play. Nothing is "blocking" the clue.
- Instead, Alice clues green to Bob as a _Trash Push_.
- Bob knows that this is a _Trash Push_, so he blind-plays his slot 1 card. It is a red 3 and it successfully plays.
- Cathy sees that this _Trash Push_ was _unnecessary_. So, Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card as an _Ignition_. It is a yellow 1 and it successfully plays.

### The Unnecessary Trash Push Finesse

- See the example image below.
- Alice can clue yellow to Cathy in order to perform a _Finesse_ on the yellow 3 into the yellow 4.
- Instead, Alice clues red to Cathy as a _Trash Push_.
- Bob knows that this is a _Trash Push_ and that the _Trash Pushed_ card is a one-away-from-playable yellow 4. Thus, this must be a _Trash Push Finesse_ that is calling for the yellow 3.
- Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card. It is a yellow 3 and it successfully plays.
- Cathy plays the yellow 4.
- Donald sees that this _Trash Push_ was _unnecessary_. So, Donald blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card as an _Ignition_. It is a green 4 and it successfully plays.

### The Unnecessary Trash Bluff (with a Trash Push)

- See the example image below.
- Alice clues number 1 to Donald on a blue 1.
- Bob knows that from Donald's perspective, Alice's clue looks like a _Play Clue_ on an unplayed 1. Donald will go on to misplay the blue 1.
- Thus, Bob knows that this is a _Trash Finesse_ or _Trash Bluff_. He blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card. It is a blue 2 and it successfully plays.
- Cathy knows that all _Trash Bluffs_ are _unnecessary_. She also sees that the _unnecessary_ component will be a _Trash Push_ instead of a _Chop Move_ (since the blue 1 was on Donald's chop). Cathy plays her previously known red 1.
- Donald also knows that _Trash Bluffs_ are to be treated as _unnecessary_. Donald blind-plays his slot 1 card to fulfill the "extra" component of the _Unnecessary Trash Bluff_. It is a red 2 and it successfully plays.

### The Unnecessary Unknown Trash Discharge (with a Trash Push)

- See the example image below.
- Alice can clue number 4 to Bob in order to get the blue 4 to play. Nothing is "blocking" the clue.
- Instead, Alice clues red to Donald, touching a trash red 1.
- Bob knows that from Donald's perspective, Alice's clue looks like a _Play Clue_ on the red 4. Donald will go on to misplay the red 1 as a red 4.
- If Bob plays his _Finesse Position_ and it successfully plays, then that will not resolve the situation — Donald will then go on to think that the red card is red 5, which is not true.
- Thus, Bob knows that this must be an _Unknown Trash Discharge_. Bob blind-plays his _Third Finesse Position_. It is a blue 4 and it successfully plays.
- Cathy sees that the _Unknown Trash Discharge_ was _unnecessary_. She also sees that the _unnecessary_ component will be a _Trash Push_ instead of a _Chop Move_ (since the red 1 was on Donald's chop). Cathy plays her previously known green 4.
- Donald also sees that the _Unknown Trash Discharge_ was _unnecessary_. Donald blind-plays his slot 2 card to fulfill the "extra" component of the _Unnecessary Unknown Trash Discharge_. It is a yellow 1 and it successfully plays.
