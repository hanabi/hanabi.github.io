## Special Moves

### The 5 Stall (Cluing Off Chop 5's)

- Normally, you are only allowed to give a _Save Clue_ to a 5 if it is on chop. So if you use number 5 to clue a 5 that is **not** on chop, then it will typically look like a _Play Clue_ on that 5 (or some other advanced strategy).
- As a special exception, in the _Early Game_, you **are** allowed to clue number 5 as a _Save Clue_ to off chop 5's. Doing this is just interpreted as a "stall" clue and that you are trying to extend the _Early Game_ for a little bit longer.
- However, you are **only** allowed to do this if there is nothing else to do, meaning that all of the "normal" _Play Clues_ and _Save Clues_ have been extinguished.
- Normally, _5 Stalls_ are only performed in the _Early Game_. However, you might see someone do a _5 Stall_ in the _Mid-Game_ if they are in a special situation where they are not allowed to discard.
- For level 8 players, there are [additional rules](level-8.mdx#the-5-stall-intermediate-section) relating to the _5 Stall_.
- For level 18 players, there is a [special interaction between _2 Saves_ and _5 Stalls_](level-18.mdx#interaction-between-2-saves--5-stalls).

<br />

### The Double Prompt / Triple Prompt / Quadruple Prompt

- Sometimes, someone can give a _Prompt_ that is prompting **two** (or more) cards with one clue, which is pretty good.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 4. This must be a _Play Clue_, because the red 4 is not on chop.
  - Bob has two clued red cards in his hand. Since Alice has indicated that the red 4 must be playable right now, he knows that his two red cards must be a red 2 and a red 3 (in order from left-to-right).
  - Bob plays the left-most card as the red 2. On Bob's next turn, he plays the other red card as the red 3.

<br />

### The Double Finesse / Triple Finesse / Quadruple Finesse

- Typically, _Finesses_ are performed by cluing a _one-away-from-playable_ card. However, it is possible to get two different people to blind-play their cards in a row if you give a clue to a _two-away-from-playable_ card. This is very efficient, as it is a 3-for-1 clue.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Donald red, which touches a red 4.
  - Bob plays red 2 from his _Finesse Position_.
  - Cathy plays red 3 from her _Finesse Position_.
  - Donald plays red 4.

<DoubleFinesse1 />

- Similarly, it is possible to get a single player to blind-play 2 cards in a row. In this situation, since they see that the blind cards are not in anyone else's hands, they will blind-play two turns in a row, playing from left to right.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 3.
  - Bob blind-plays red 1 from slot 1.
  - Cathy would normally think that she has red 2, which would connect to the red 1 that was just played. However, she sees that when the clue happened, there was a red 2 next to the red 1.
  - Thus, Cathy discards, giving Bob a chance to blind-play the red 2. If he does not blind-play it, then it was a normal _Finesse_ and she has red 2. If he does blind-play it, then it was a _Double Finesse_ and she has red 3.
  - On his next turn, Bob blind-plays red 2 from slot 2. Cathy now knows that she has the red 3.

### The Prompt + Finesse

- In general, remember that players will always assume _Prompts_ over _Finesses_. Thus, is it possible to do a clue that _Prompts_ a card from a player's hand **and then** gets them to blind-play their _Finesse Position_ card on the next turn.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Bob has a clued red card in his hand on slot 4.
  - Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 4 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob knows he must have both red 2 and red 3 (in order to make the red 4 playable), but he only has one clued red card in his hand. So this must be both a _Prompt_ on him and a _Finesse_ on him at the same time.
  - Since _Prompts_ take precedence over _Finesses_, he plays the clued red card first from slot 4. It is red 2 and it successfully plays.
  - Normally, Cathy would think she has a red 3. However, as she saw a red 3 on Bob's finesse position at the moment of giving the clue, she waits a turn to give him a chance to play it. If Bob doesn't blind-play anything, then Cathy should have the red 3, and she can play it on her next turn.
  - On his next turn, Bob blind-plays slot 2 as red 3 (His _Finesse Position_ at the time of the clue was slot 1, but he drew a card, and now it slid down to slot 2.)
  - Cathy now knows she has the connecting red 4.

### The Reverse Finesse

- In a normal _Finesse_, you give a clue to a player who comes after the player blind-playing a card.
  - i.e. clue --> blind-play --> clued-card plays
- If you give a _Finesse_ clue to someone who gets to have a turn **before** the blind-play occurs, it is called a _Reverse Finesse_. This is more complicated than a normal _Finesse_ and is harder to see.
  - i.e. clue --> clued player does unrelated action --> blind-play --> clued-card plays
- Because we agree that _Reverse Finesses_ should exist, players need to be careful before playing any cards. Players in this situation need to check out everyone else's _Finesse Position_. If a card in someone's _Finesse Position_ is playable and "connects" to the clue, then **they should defer playing the clued card** for at least one go-around and wait to see what happens.
- If a blind-play does happen, then it means that the clued card is the next card in the chain.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Bob red, which touches his red 2.
  - Next, it is Bob's turn. Normally, Bob would think that he had the red 1, and play it immediately.
  - However, Bob also notices that on Cathy has a red 1 on her slot 1 position. Thus, he has to give a chance for Cathy to prove whether or not a _Reverse Finesse_ is happening. If Cathy does not blind-play anything, then Bob should have the red 1, and he can play it on his next turn.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays the red 1. Bob now knows that he has the connecting red 2.

<ReverseFinesse />

- If the player with the "connecting" card **does not** blind-play, then the clued card is probably the other copy, and can be played on the next turn.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - The setup is the same as the last example. Bob is clued red, so he suspects a _Reverse Finesse_ is occurring and discards.
  - Cathy does an unrelated action.
  - Now Bob knows that the red card in his hand is actually the red 1.

<br />

### The Self-Finesse

- It is also possible to perform a _Finesse_ on a player by giving **them** a clue.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching one 3 on slot 2.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy knows that this was a _Play Clue_ on the 3, but there are no 3's that are directly playable. Thus, someone must have the connecting 2. Since Bob discarded, Cathy must be the one who has the connecting 2.
  - Thus, Cathy plays her _Finesse Position_ card as **any** 2. It is a red 2 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy now knows that her 3 must connect to the 2, so she marks her 3 as a red 3.

<SelfFinesse />

- Note that _Self-Finesses_ can be difficult to perform because the player receiving the clue will **only** consider the possibility of a _Self-Finesse_ **if there are no other possibilities** for the clue. For example:
  - If the clue looks like it _could_ just be a normal/direct _Play Clue_ on a card, then the clue receiver will not blind-play anything - they will just play the card that was clued.
  - If the clue looks like it _could_ be a _Prompt_, then the clue receiver will not play anything and assume that it is a _Prompt_. (At least, until the other player has had a chance to play the _Prompted_ card.)
  - If the clue looks like it _could_ be a _Reverse Finesse_, then the clue receiver will not play anything and assume that it is a _Reverse Finesse_. (At least, until the other player has had a chance to blind-play the card.)

<br />

## General Principles

<br />

### Trash

- _Trash_ cards are defined as cards that have already been played. Thus, they are useless to the team.
- Players should generally avoid "touching" trash cards with a clue, as doing so would violate _Good Touch Principle_.
  - Rarely, it can be useful to deliberately clue a trash card and violate _Good Touch Principle_ in order to perform a special move. Several such moves are covered later on.
- In the case where a suit is partially "dead", the unneeded cards are also considered trash. For example, if both copies of the red 3 have been discarded, then the red 4 and the red 5 are both considered trash.

<br />

## Common Mistakes

<br />

### Stomping on a Finesse

- This is the term used for when a player clues a card directly that was going to be blind-played from a _Finesse_. Typically, this means that the player who gave the clue was not paying attention and failed to see that a _Finesse_ happened at all.
- _Stomping_ on a _Finesse_ essentially wastes a clue for the team.

<br />

### What to Do After a Strike

- When a card is misplayed and goes to the discard pile, the team accumulates a _strike_ (which is also referred to as a _bomb_).
- If three strikes are accumulated, the team will get a score of 0. This is to be **avoided at all costs**.
  - One exception is when players are explicitly going for a perfect score in a really tough variant, but this is less common.
- Building on this concept, it can also be **very bad** to get **two strikes in a row**. For example, say that Alice performs a bad clue and Bob misplays, causing a strike. And then Cathy "still believes" the original clue (thinking that Bob was the one who made the mistake instead of Alice), and Cathy goes on to misplay, causing yet another strike.
- So, in general, we want to **isolate one mistake to one strike**. Why? Since Hanabi is so difficult, mistakes are common, and we don't want to push the team to the precipice of failure after one tiny mistake. That kind of thing is not very good for the overall win-rate.
- This means that when a strike happens, **the state of information should "reset"** back to what it was before the mistake happened.
- For example, if Alice clues red to Cathy, and Bob misplays a card, then Cathy should **not** go on to play any of her red cards, and Cathy should **not** make any assumptions about what her red cards could be. Obviously, some kind of mistake happened, and Cathy should sit and wait patiently for further instructions.
- This convention for what to do after a strike applies from level 2 and goes all the way to max level.

<br />

### The Wrong Prompt

- First, see the section on [What to Do After a Strike](#what-to-do-after-a-strike).
- Normally, after a strike happens, you are supposed to relax and not make any additional assumptions.
- However, there is one major exception. A common mistake in Hanabi is to attempt to perform a _Finesse_ when there is a matching clued card in that player's hand. Since _Prompts_ take precedence over _Finesses_, the player will always play their matching clued card first.
- When a card is _Prompted_ and it misplays, everyone can read into this mistake - it was almost certainly a _Wrong Prompt_, meaning that the player who gave the clue probably intended for the _Finesse Position_ card to play instead.
- Thus, if there is nothing else special about the situation, the player who misplayed should go on to play their _Finesse Position_ card on the next turn.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Alice sees that Bob has a red 2 on his _Finesse Position_.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 3 as a _Play Clue_. She is trying to perform a _Finesse_.
  - Bob sees that Alice is signaling that he has the red 2. This must be a _Prompt_, so Bob plays his clued red card as a red 2.
  - However, it is actually a red 4 and it misplays. Oops! Alice forgot that Bob had a clued red card in his hand.
  - Bob knows that this was a _Wrong Prompt_. He really does the have the red 2 and it was on his _Finesse Position_ at the time of the clue.
  - On his next turn, Bob blind-plays his slot 2. (It is on slot 2 now because he drew a card when he misplayed the red 4.)
