title: Level 1 - Fundamentals
---

- Level 1 strategies can be learned with no games of Hanabi played. You can either learn them before you play your first game or after you play a few games to learn the basic mechanics.
- This stuff is mostly a repeat of the [beginner's guide](beginner.mdx), but we go into a bit more detail here.
- If you have not read the beginner's guide yet, **STOP NOW** and read that instead. Only come back here after you have played 5-10 games. (This page is just intended to be used as a reference for players who have already read the beginner's guide.)

<br />

## Conventions

<br />

### Chop

- When players have to discard, they typically discard their right-most unclued card.
- A player's chop is formally defined as **the next unclued card that they would discard if they had nothing else to do**.
- If a player has a clued card that is known useless, then they will typically discard the useless card **instead** of discarding their chop. (But the useless card does **not** count as the chop - their chop remains the right-most unclued card.)

<br />

### The Definition of Playable

- First, see the section on _[Delayed Play Clues](beginner/delayed-play-clues.mdx)_ from the beginner's guide.
- When we say that an unclued card is currently _playable_, we do **not** mean that the card would be able to play on the stacks right this instant. If an unclued card is _playable_, then what we really mean is that it would be legal for someone to give either a _Play Clue_ **or** a _Delayed Play Clue_ to the card.
- In other words, if an unclued _playable_ card was given a _Delayed Play Clue_, that card would eventually play on the stack without any additional clues needing to be given by anyone else - all of the in-between cards, if any, would be present and accounted for at the moment that the _Play Clue_ was given.

<br />

### One-Away-From-Playable Cards

- As noted in the previous section, sometimes unclued cards happen to be _playable_.
- Additionally, sometimes unclued cards happen to be _one-away-from-playable_.
- A card is _one-away-from-playable_ if only one other card would need to be given a _Play Clue_ or a _Delayed Play Clue_ in order to make the card _playable_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - No red cards are played on the stacks.
  - No player has any red 1's in their hand.
  - Bob has a red 2 with a number 2 clue on it. (It was saved with a _2 Save_ clue earlier on.)
  - Cathy has an unclued red 3 in her hand.
  - Alice knows that the unclued red 3 is currently _one-away-from-playable_, because there is only one card needed in order to make it _playable_ - the red 1.
- Players are **not** allowed to give _Play Clues_ or _Delayed Play Clues_ to _one-away-from-playable_ cards - they are not playable yet!
- Players are **not** allowed to give _Save Clues_ to _one-away-from-playable_ cards - unless they also happen to be critical.

<br />

### Save Clues

- You are **only** allowed to give a _Save Clue_ to a card that is on chop.
  - This means that if a clue focuses a non-chop card, then it must be a _Play Clue_!
- You are **not** allowed to give a _Save Clue_ to any card you want. You are **only** allowed to give a _Save Clue_ on these specific cards:
  1. 5's (with a _5 Save_ clue, e.g. number 5)
  1. 2's (with a _2 Save_ clue, e.g. number 2)
  1. Critical cards (with either color or number)
- Additionally, everyone in the group also agrees to never let anyone discard a (unique) playable card. However, a clue to a unique playable card would be defined as a _Play Clue_, not a _Save Clue_.

<br />

### Clue Focus

There is a 4-step process for determining the focus of a clue:

1. If no cards are new, then **the focus is on the left-most re-touched card**.
1. If only one card is new, then **the focus is on the new card**.
1. If two or more cards are new, and one of them was on chop, then **the focus is on the chop**.
1. If two or more cards are new, and none of them were on chop, then **the focus is on the left-most new card**.

This process is represented in the following flowchart:

  alt="Clue Focus Flowchart"
  class="flowchart"

<br />

### The Early Game

- The _Early Game_ is the period of time before someone discards for the first time.
- Players **must** "extinguish" all of the available _Play Clues_ and _Save Clues_ on the board before ending the _Early Game_.
  - As outlined in the [beginner's guide](beginner/minimum-clue-value-principle.mdx), "extinguishing" all the _Play Clues_ does **not** include giving _Tempo Clues_. _Tempo Clues_ do not meet _Minimum Clue Value Principle_, so in general, they should almost never be given.
- For level 9+ players, there are [some additional rules](level-9.mdx#the-early-game-severity-1-stalling) about the Early Game. (Don't worry about them for now if you are only level 1.)

<br />

## Special Moves

<br />

### The 2 Save

- A _2 Save_ is when someone uses a number 2 clue to clue a previously-unclued 2 that is on someone's chop. (Everyone agrees that this is just a _Save Clue_ instead of a _Play Clue_.)
- By definition, you can only perform a _2 Save_ with a number clue.
  - If the other copy of the 2 is in the discard pile, then you can save it with color. But that would not be a _2 Save_, that would just be a "normal" _Save Clue_.

#### The Visible Rule

- Players are **not allowed** to perform a _2 Save_ on a 2 if the other copy of the 2 is visible in someone else's hand.

#### Double Chop 2's

- The exception to the _Visible Rule_ is when the same 2 is on two people's chops at the same time. In that situation, players are allowed to _2 Save_ whichever one they want. And if it is the _Early Game_, then players **must** choose to save one of them before giving a _5 Stall_ or before discarding to initiate the _Mid-Game_.

<br />

### The Prompt

- A _Prompt_ is when you get a player to play a clued card that was previously unknown.
- If the player **was already going to play** the card, then **it isn't a _Prompt_**. _Prompts_ can only be on cards that were not going to play otherwise.
- An example of a _Prompt_ can be found in the [beginner's guide](beginner/prompt.mdx).
- For level 5 players, see the _[Prompts in Multi-Color Variants](level-5.mdx#prompts-in-multi-color-variants)_ section.

<br />

### The Finesse

- A _Finesse_ is when you get a player to blind-play a card to fulfill a promise that a certain card is playable right now.
- _Finesses_ are covered in detail in the [beginner's guide](beginner/finesse.mdx).
- _Finesses_ must be on "connecting" cards. (For example, the red 1 leads directly into the red 2, so they are considered to be a "connecting" pair of cards.)
- When a player is _Finessed_, they should blind-play their card right away in order to demonstrate it!

<br />

### Finesse Position

- A player's _Finesse Position_ refers to the slot that their **left-most unclued card** is in.

<br />

### Finessed Cards

- Even though _Finessed_ cards are unclued, you can think of them as having an invisible clue on them. (Because they are already "gotten".)
- Thus, if a clue touches a _Finessed_ card and some other card that did not have a clue on it, then the focus of the clue would be on the other card (because the focus of a clue is always on the "new" card introduced).

<br />

### Prompts > Finesses

- **_Prompts_ always take precedence over _Finesses_**.
- This means that if Alice has to decide between:
  1. playing a card in her hand with a red clue on it, and
  1. blind-playing a potential red card from her _Finesse Position_
- Then Alice should always do #1.

## Website Features

- If you have played a few games on [Hanab Live](https://hanab.live), then you may have noticed that the website has several features.
- The website has an [extensive documentation](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/blob/master/docs/FEATURES.mdx#notes). You can get to that page by pressing the "Help" icon in the upper-right part of the website lobby.
- Below are a few of the most important features that a beginner should know about.

<br />

### Card Notes

<!-- lint disable no-undefined-references -->

- If you are following the beginner's guide, then you should be [writing card notes](beginner/card-notes.mdx) in every game.
- Certain special notes [change the appearance of the card for you](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/blob/master/docs/FEATURES.mdx#notes).
  - If you write the name of a card like "red 2" or "r2", the image of the card will snap to the written card.
  - A note of "f" is used to indicate a card is _Finessed_ (meaning that it will blind-play in the future). The website draws a special border around _Finessed_ cards.
    - You can use `shift + right-click` as a shortcut to add this note.
  - A note of "cm" is used to indicate a card is _Chop Moved_. The website draws a special border around _Chop Moved_ cards. (_Chop Moves_ are a special convention introduced in level 4. If you are a level 1 player, don't worry about this for now.)
    - You can use `alt + right-click` as a shortcut to add this note.
  - You can also use brackets to stack multiple notes. For example, "[f] [red 2]".

<!-- lint enable no-undefined-references -->

<br />

### Rewind

- During a game, clicking the arrow button in the bottom-left-hand corner opens the [in-game replay feature](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-live/blob/master/docs/FEATURES.mdx#in-game-replay).
  - You can also use the arrow keys as a shortcut to move backwards and forwards through time.
- This is useful if you need to recall what happened several turns ago.

<br />

### Empathy

- If you press the space bar or left-click on someone else's hand, you can see how the cards appear to them.
- This is the equivalent of asking "what do you know about your cards?" in real life.
- This feature is referred to as "empathy".
