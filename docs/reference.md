title: Intro & Warning
---

The *H-Group* has come up with many different strategies. It is helpful to give specific names to each strategy to aid in both discussion and comprehension. If you know the general way we play but don't know about a specific kind of move, then you can look it up here.

From time to time, we decide to change an old convention or add a new one. Convention updates are listed in the `#announcements` channel on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp).

## ⚠️ New Player Warning ⚠️

If you are a new player, **do not bother reading the strategy reference**. It is much better to simply read the [beginner's guide](beginner) and then start playing games with the group. This website is meant to be used as a reference as you continue to naturally improve at the game.

It is **not** a good idea to rush to learn everything here as quickly as possible. In fact, doing so is **actively harmful**. **Using higher level strategies does not make you a better player.** The extra efficiency from fancy tricks is often outweighed by mistakes or miscommunications caused by the additional complexity.

## ⚠️ Rigidity Warning ⚠️

Even though the strategy reference outlines the "correct" thing to do in a lot of situations, these are not hard and fast rules. Rather, they are intended to show the "default" or "common" case. Everything is flexible and can be modified by using wits, judgment, and a lot of experience.
