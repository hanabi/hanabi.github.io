## Conventions

<br />

### Ignition

- An *Ignition* is a type of move that makes someone blind-play a card from their *Finesse Position*.
- An *Ignition* is different from a *Finesse* and a *Bluff* because the blind-play from an *Ignition* is:
  - unrelated to the clue that was given
    - e.g. It does not "connect", which is unlike a *Finesse*, but like a *Bluff*.
  - unrelated to the *playability* of the clued card
    - e.g. Nothing needs to be "proved" to the player who got clued, which is unlike a *Finesse*, and unlike a *Bluff*.

<br />

### Double Ignition

- Several types of "useless" clues trigger a *Double Ignition*. These different types are listed below.
- When a *Double Ignition* is triggered, it means that two players on the team need to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card as any playable card.
  - *Double Ignition* does not necessarily have to be on the next two players. It can be on anyone.
- In most circumstances, a *Double Ignition* should be clear. This is because the two players that have a playable card will each see that the clue giver should have clued the other playable card directly (instead of giving a "useless" clue).
- Sometimes, three players on the team will have playable cards on *Finesse Position*. If a *Double Ignition* is performed in this case, similar to how an *Ambiguous Finesse* works, it will "get" the two cards from the final two players. (Bob will do nothing because he sees that the *Double Ignition* is on Cathy and Donald.)

<br />

## Special Moves

<br />

### Priority Ignition

- Players generally perform *Priority Bluffs* by tricking players into thinking they have a specific card. However, it is also possible to perform a *Priority Ignition*. For example:
  - Alice has a three known playable cards: red 1, blue 4, and blue 5.
  - Bob has a known red 2.
  - Alice is expected to play the red 1 into the red 2, so the red 1 has *Priority*.
  - Instead, Alice plays the blue 4.
  - Normally, Bob would think that this is a *Priority Finesse* on the blue 5. However, both he and Alice know that Alice has the blue 5.
  - This must be a *Priority Ignition*, so Bob plays his *Finesse Position* card as any playable card.

<br />

### The Trash Double Ignition

- Towards the end of the game, if a player clues one or more brand-new trash cards, and the cards are known to be trash, then there are usually 2 possible interpretations:

#### 1) A Late-Game Trash Chop Move

- Sometimes, players perform a *Trash Chop Move* by cluing known trash in another player's hand (off-chop).
- However, players can know that *Trash Chop Move* is impossible if:
  - they are not the clue-receiver and they can see that the *Chop Moved* card is bad
  - they are the clue-receiver and they can determine that they are no cards left to *Chop Move* (meaning that all of the cards are accounted for, or all of the remaining cards could be given a direct *Play Clue* or a direct *Save Clue*).

#### 2) A Late-Game *Trash Push* (or a *Trash Push Finesse*)

- Sometimes, players perform a *Trash Push* (or a *Trash Push Finesse*) by cluing known trash in another player's hand (on-chop).
- However, players can know that a *Trash Push* is impossible if:
  - they are not the clue-receiver and they can see that the "pushed" card is bad
  - they are the clue-receiver and they can determine that they are no more cards left to *Trash Push*

#### Otherwise, a Trash Double Ignition

- If the known trash clue cannot be either of these two things, then it communicates a *Trash Double Ignition*.
- Players should always assume a *Trash Double Ignition* over a *Bad Trash Chop Move Ejection*, since the latter is very rare. (*Bad Trash Chop Move Ejection* is an advanced move that is covered later on.)

### The Replay Double Ignition

- When a player re-clues a globally-known playable card, it is a "useless" clue.
- Usually, when this occurs, it is because a player is in a [stalling situation](level-8.md#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table) and cannot discard. (This is most common in [the *End-Game*](level-7.md#burning-end-game-stalling).
- If a player is not in a stalling situation, then they must be trying to send a deeper message - a *Double Ignition*. This is called a *Replay Double Ignition* because you are re-giving a *Play Clue*.
- The *Replay Double Ignition* must not introduce any new cards as part of the clue.
- The *Replay Double Ignition* can be performed all throughout the game. (Conversely, the *Trash Double Ignition* can only be performed towards the end of the game.)
- Also, see the section on [Replay Ejection](extras/ejections.md#the-replay-ejection).

### The Poke Double Ignition

- When a player re-clues a globally-known trash card, it is a "useless" clue.
- Usually, when this occurs, it is because a player is in a [stalling situation](level-8.md#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table) and cannot discard.
- If a player is not in a stalling situation, then they must be trying to send a deeper message - a *Double Ignition*. This is called a *Poke Double Ignition* because by re-touching a trash card, it is like you are poking the player.
- The *Poke Double Ignition* must not introduce any new cards as part of the clue.
- The *Poke Double Ignition* can be performed all throughout the game. (Conversely, the *Trash Double Ignition* can only be performed towards the end of the game.)
- Also, see the section on [Poke Ejection](extras/ejections.md#the-poke-ejection).
