## Conventions

<br />

### Ignition

- An *Ignition* is a type of move that makes someone blind-play a card from their *Finesse Position*.
- An *Ignition* is different from a *Finesse* and a *Bluff* because the blind-play from an *Ignition* is:
  - unrelated to the clue that was given
    - i.e. It does not "connect", which is unlike a *Finesse*, but like a *Bluff*.
  - unrelated to the *playability* of the clued card
    - i.e. Nothing needs to be "proved" to the player who got clued, which is unlike a *Finesse*, and unlike a *Bluff*.

<br />

### Double Ignition

- Several types of "useless" clues trigger a *Double Ignition*. These different types are listed below.
- When a *Double Ignition* is triggered, it means that two players on the team need to blind-play their *Finesse Position* as any playable card.
  - *Double Ignition* does not necessarily have to be on the next two players. It can be on anyone.
- In most circumstances, a *Double Ignition* should be clear. This is because the two players that have a playable card will each see that the clue giver should have clued the other playable card directly (instead of giving a "useless" clue).
- Sometimes, an *Ambiguous Double Ignition* can happen (when three or more players have a playable card on *Finesse Position*). In this situation:
  - The first *Ignition* **must always be on Bob**, unless Alice had a very good reason to give the clue (i.e. Bob has a known-playable card already).
  - The second *Ignition* **must always be on the last player with a playable card**. (This is because the players in the middle will think that the last person is supposed to play, similar to how a normal *Ambiguous Finesse* works.)

<br />

## Special Moves

<br />

### The Trash Double Ignition

- Towards the end of the game, if a player clues one or more new trash cards, and the cards are known to be trash, then there are usually 2 possible interpretations:

#### 1) A Late-Game Trash Chop Move

- Sometimes, players perform a *Trash Chop Move* by cluing known-trash in another player's hand (off chop).
- However, players can know that *Trash Chop Move* is impossible if:
  - they are not the clue-receiver and they can see that the *Chop Moved* card is bad
  - they are the clue-receiver and they can determine that they are no cards left to *Chop Move* (meaning that all of the cards are accounted for, or all of the remaining cards could be given a direct *Play Clue* or a direct *Save Clue*).

#### 2) A Late-Game *Trash Push* (or a *Trash Push Finesse*)

- Sometimes, players perform a *Trash Push* (or a *Trash Push Finesse*) by cluing known-trash in another player's hand (on chop).
- However, players can know that a *Trash Push* is impossible if:
  - they are not the clue-receiver and they can see that the "pushed" card is bad
  - they are the clue-receiver and they can determine that they are no more cards left to *Trash Push*

#### Otherwise, a Trash Double Ignition

- If the known-trash clue cannot be either of these two things, then it communicates a *Trash Double Ignition*.
- Players should always assume a *Trash Double Ignition* over a *Bad Trash Chop Move Ejection*, since the latter is very rare. (*Bad Trash Chop Move Ejection* is an advanced move that is covered later on.)
- Also, see the section on [Trash Ejection](extras/ejections.md#the-trash-ejection).

<br />

### The Replay Double Ignition

- When a player re-clues a globally-known playable card, it is a "useless" clue.
- Usually, when this occurs, it is because a player is in a [stalling situation](level-8.md#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table) and cannot discard. (This is most common in [the *End-Game*](level-7.md#burning-end-game-stalling).)
- If a player is not in a stalling situation, then they must be trying to send a deeper message - a *Double Ignition*. This is called a *Replay Double Ignition* because you are re-giving a *Play Clue*.
- The *Replay Double Ignition* must not introduce any new cards as part of the clue.
- The *Replay Double Ignition* can be performed all throughout the game. (Conversely, the *Trash Double Ignition* can only be performed towards the end of the game.)
- Also, see the section on [Replay Ejection](extras/ejections.md#the-replay-ejection).

<br />

### The Poke Double Ignition

- When a player re-clues a globally-known-trash card, it is a "useless" clue.
- Usually, when this occurs, it is because a player is in a [stalling situation](level-8.md#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table) and cannot discard.
- If a player is not in a stalling situation, then they must be trying to send a deeper message - a *Double Ignition*. This is called a *Poke Double Ignition* because by re-touching a trash card, it is like you are poking the player.
- The *Poke Double Ignition* must not introduce any new cards as part of the clue.
- The *Poke Double Ignition* can be performed all throughout the game. (Conversely, the *Trash Double Ignition* can only be performed towards the end of the game.)
- Also, see the section on [Poke Ejection](extras/ejections.md#the-poke-ejection).

<br />

### The Chop Move Ignition

- If a playable card is on chop, the natural thing to do is to give it a *Chop-Focus Play Clue*. If a player *Chop Moves* the playable card instead, this is very strange. If there is not a good reason to do so, then the cluer is trying to communicate something extra.
- In this situation, they intend for an *Ignition* on the next player. Since a *Chop Move* causes a blind-play, the *Chop Moved* player will know that the *Chop Moved* card is playable.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: blue 4, blue 4, blue 5, red 1
  - Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a blue 5 on slot 3.
  - It is now Bob's turn. Bob sees that since there were other *Play Clues* for Alice to give, Cathy will interpret this as an *Early 5's Chop Move*.
  - Bob also knows that it is nonsensical to *Chop Move* a playable red 1 - Alice could have just give a red *Chop-Focus Play Clue* to the red 1.
  - Thus, this must be a *Chop Move Ignition*. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  - Cathy knows that if this was an *Early 5's Chop Move*, then Bob would not have blind-played anything. Since he blind-played his *Finesse Position* card, this must be a *Chop Move Ignition*. Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card (the card to the right of the clued 5).

<ChopMoveIgnition />

- Sometimes, it can be useful to *Chop Move* a playable card. Something is only a *Chop Move Ignition* if there is not some other good reason for the *Chop Move*. Specifically, the player might want to:
  - Avoid violating *Good Touch Principle*.
  - Save a *Delayed Playable* card that is followed by a critical card.
  - Save two important cards when there are a lot of cards to deal with and the team is low on clues.
  - Get a blind-play from *Elimination* when the duplicate is visible.

<br />

#### Interaction with 5 Rank Clues

- Normally, a number 5 rank clue to a 5 that is one-away-from-chop would be either:
  - a *5 Stall*
  - a *5's Chop Move*
  - a *Play Clue* on the 5
- If a *5 Stall* is impossible (i.e. it is not a stalling situation), then a *5's Chop Move* on a playable card would normally be treated as a *Play Clue* on the 5.
- However, for level 20 players, *Play Clues* like this are **turned off**. In other words, every number 5 clue that focuses a 5 that is exactly one-away-from-chop would always be a *5's Chop Move*. This is referred to as the *Chop Move Ignition Interaction*.
- The *Chop Move Ignition Interaction* can be tricky for players, since *Chop Move Ignitions* can look like normal *Finesses*. Players need to remember that the blind-play relates to the card being *Chop Moved*, not the 5 directly.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the *Mid-Game*.
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks.
  - Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: blue 4, green 3, blue 4, blue 5, blue 1
  - Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching the blue 5 on slot 4.
  - Bob expected Alice to clue number 1 to Cathy. Thus, this must be a *Chop Move Ignition*. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is red 4 and it successfully plays.
  - From Cathy's perspective, she first thought that Alice's clue was a *5's Chop Move*. However, if that were the case, Bob would not have blind-played anything.
  - Furthermore, Cathy knows that *Play Clues* on 5's one-away-from-chop using rank clues are turned off. Thus, Bob's blind-play must indicate a *Chop Move Ignition*.
  - Thus, Cathy's 5 can be any color (including blue). Cathy blind-plays her slot 5 card.

<ChopMoveIgnitionInteraction />

- Importantly, this interaction is **turned off** in the *End-Game*.
- Note that sometimes, players will use a rank 5 clue to touch an actual playable 5 that is exactly one-away-from-chop. Regardless of whether or not the 5 is playable, the next player needs to react as if it wasn't playable. (This is because it is agreed that all *Play Clue* interpretations are turned off.)
