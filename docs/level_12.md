## Special Moves

### The Trash Bluff

- Normally, when a trash card is clued, it signifies a *Trash Chop Move* or a *Trash Push*. However, for both of these strategies to work, it is assumed that the recipient of the clue will know that the card that was touched is useless.
- What if the recipient of the clue does **not** know that the card that the clued card is trash? Then, they will go on to misplay that card, mistaking it for a "normal" *Play Clue*.
- If players misrepresent the identity of a trash card in this way, it is a signal for the next person to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card. This is extremely similar to how a *Finesse* or a *Bluff* works (e.g. a clued card has been misrepresented as being immediately playable).
- *Trash Bluffs* are a good tool to get a card played that is sitting behind other annoying cards.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks **except** for the red 1.
  - Cathy has no clued cards in her hand.
  - Alice clues Cathy number 1, which only touches her newest (slot 1) card. This card is a blue 1, but Cathy will assume that it is a red 1.
  - Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card, and it is a playable blue 2.
  - Cathy now knows that her 1 must not be red 1, or else Bob would not have blind-played anything. The 1 must be some other trash card.
- Just like normal *Bluffs*, *Trash Bluffs* can only be done while in *Bluff Seat*.
- Normal *Bluffs* take precedence over *Trash Bluffs*. This means that players can **only** use cards to *Trash Bluff* with if they will be proved to be trash by a blind-play.
  - For example, if not all of the 1's have been played on the stacks, then you can use a number 1 clue to initiate a *Trash Bluff*, because a blind-play will prove that the clued 1 is not a good 1.
  - For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 3, then you **cannot** use a red clue to initiate a *Trash Bluff*, because a blind-play will make the clued card look like the red 5.
  - For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 4, then you can use a red clue to initiate a *Trash Bluff*, because a blind-play will prove that the clued card is not a red 5.
- In the case where multiple cards are clued as part of a *Trash Bluff*, **all** of the touched cards are considered to be trash. However, the focus of the clue should be the first thing discarded, which allows for the possibility of your teammates to give a follow-up *Fix Clue*.

### The Trash Finesse

- In a *Finesse*, we would say that the clue "matches" the blind-play. For example, a blue clue on a blue 2 matches a blind-play of blue 1. Or, a number 2 clue on blue 2 matches a blind-play of blue 1.
- In a *Bluff*, we would say that the clue does not "match" the blind-play. For example, a blue clue on a blue 2 does not match a blind-play of a red 1. Or, a number 2 clue on a blue 2 does not match the blind-play of a red 2.
- In the *Trash Bluff* example above, a blue 1 is used to *Trash Bluff* a blue 2. Similar to a *Bluff*, we would say this number 1 clue does not match the blind-play of a blue 2.
- What if the *Trash Bluff* instead got a red 1 to blind-play? In this context, the red 1 would actually "match" the number 1 clue. Another way of saying this is that by cluing the trash 1 with a number 1 clue, the clue giver is saying that they **see** a matching 1 that is good.
- Thus, it is possible to perform a *Trash Bluff* outside of *Bluff Seat* if the "matching" card is on someone's *Finesse Position*. When this is done, it promises that someone has that specific card, so we call it a *Trash Finesse* rather than a *Trash Bluff*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks except for red 1.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches a blue 1. To Donald, this will look like it is a red 1.
  - At first glance, Bob might think this is a *Trash Bluff*, causing him to blind-play his *Finesse Position* card as either red 1 or some other currently-playable card.
  - However, Bob also sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her *Finesse Position*. Thus, Alice's clue was a *Trash Finesse* instead of a *Trash Bluff*, since it is promises a playable 1.
  - Thus, Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card and it is red 1.
  - Donald discards his known-trash 1.
- *Double Trash Finesses* are explicitly disallowed. Thus, it is possible to perform a *Trash Finesse* in a situation like this:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks except for red 1 and blue 1.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches two green 1's on slot 1 and 2. To Donald, this will look like it is both the red 1 and the blue 1.
  - Like in the previous example, Bob sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her *Finesse Position*.
  - At first glance, Bob might think that Alice is promising both red 1 and blue 1, which would mean that he would need to blind-play the blue 1.
  - However, a *Trash Finesse* only promises at least one matching card, and since he sees that Cathy has a matching card, then that is good enough. Thus, Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card and it is red 1.
  - Donald knows that the focus of the clue (slot 1) is certainly trash, since that caused Cathy to blind-play.
  - Furthermore, Donald knows that his slot 2 card is also trash, because all the cards touched in a *Trash Bluff* or *Trash Finesse* are guaranteed to be trash.

### The Reverse Trash Finesse

- First, see the section on the *[Trash Finesse](#the-trash-finesse)*.
- It is also possible to perform a *Trash Finesse* in reverse. This is much harder to see than a forward *Trash Finesse*. Even so, players should generally entertain the possibility of this occurring.
- When a clue looks like it could be a *Reverse Trash Finesse*, the player who receives the clue is forced into immediately discarding the card. If it was indeed a *Reverse Trash Finesse*, it will be a trash card and it will immediately demonstrate what is going on. Alternatively, if the clue was a normal *Play Clue* on a playable card, then the discard will be a *Gentleman's Discard*. By discarding, it covers both cases.
- For example, in 3-player game:
  - The red 1 is played on the stacks. All of the 2's are played on the other stacks.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 1 card as a *Play Clue*.
  - From Bob's perspective, this is probably just a *Play Clue* on the red 2 (which happens to be the final 2 that needs to be played).
  - However, Bob sees that Cathy also has a red 2 on her *Finesse Position*. That means that this could be a *Reverse Trash Finesse*.
  - If it is a *Reverse Trash Finesse*, then his 2 is a trash 2 (e.g. green 2). By immediately discarding it, it will prove to Cathy that *she* has a red 2.
  - Alternatively, if Bob does indeed have the red 2, then he can discard it to perform a *Gentleman's Discard* on Cathy.
  - Either way, discarding will cover both cases. Bob discards the 2 and it is revealed to be a green 2.
  - Cathy comes next. Cathy was highly surprised when Alice gave Bob a number 2 clue on the green 2. From Cathy's perspective of Bob's perspective, the green 2 clue would immediately misplay as red 2. However, when Bob discards the green 2 instead of playing it, Alice's plan becomes clear. Cathy had the red 2 all along. Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as red 2.
- Note that *Reverse Trash Finesses* should not always be entertained and **depend on context**. Specifically, towards the end of the game, *Reverse Trash Finesses* are "turned off". This is because towards the end of the game, the team needs tempo, and *Reverse Trash Finesses* are slow and require even more discarding.

### The Trash Push

- Normally, when a useless card is clued, it signifies a *Trash Chop Move*. However, what if the useless card is actually the card on chop? Then it wouldn't be *Chop Moving* anything.
- From *Good Touch Principle*, we know that it is pointless to spend a clue to touch a useless card on someone's chop, because if we just do nothing, the useless card will get automatically discarded.
- Subsequently, if this is done deliberately, it must have a meaning. By doing this, it means that we want to "push" the card that is next to the useless card onto the table.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has no clued cards in his hand. His chop is his slot 5.
  - Alice clues Bob number 1, which only touches his slot 5 card.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 4 card, and it is a playable red 2.
- Sometimes, a *Trash Push* is the only way to get a card played that is sitting between two other annoying cards.
- Similar to a *Bluff*, *Trash Pushes* must be immediately playable and should generally be demonstrated immediately. (This is unlike other similar moves like the *5 Pull*, which may have to wait a while.)

### A Trash Flowchart

There are a lot of different moves that involve cluing trash. [Here is a flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanabi/hanabi.github.io/main/static/img/flowcharts/cluing_trash_flowchart.png) for determining the difference between the different types of special moves that touch trash. (The flowchart contains some strategies that have not been covered yet, but the three most important moves to understand are the *Trash Chop Move*, the *Trash Finesse/Bluff*, and the *Trash Push*.)

### Trash Touch Elimination

- After deciding on the target of a clue, players carefully choose between using a color clue and a number clue in order to avoid violating *Good Touch Principle* with the ancillary cards that will be touched (since every clued card is treated as a card that will eventually be played). Sometimes, when both a color clue **and** a number would violate *Good Touch Principle*, players are forced to pick between the lesser of two evils.
- However, sometimes you can see that it **is** possible to use a color or number clue to uniquely touch a clue target without "picking up" extra bad cards. So, when extra bad cards are deliberately touched in this way, it is conveying an extra special message.
- When this occurs and there is exactly one "missing" card, players should write an *Elimination Note* in their hand for the missing card. This is called *Trash Touch Elimination*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks. All of the other suits have the 1 played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: red 4, red 1, blue 1, green 1, yellow 1.
  - Alice wants to give a play clue to the red 4. Everyone else on the team (other than Bob) can see that she can give either number 4 or red.
    - If Alice clues number 4, then it will uniquely touch the red 4 (which will satisfy *Good Touch Principle*).
    - If Alice clues red, then it will touch the red 4 and the red 1 (which will **violate** *Good Touch Principle*).
  - Alice clues red to Bob. Since nothing was stopping her from cluing number 4, this is very strange.
  - Bob plays the red 4.
  - There is only one "missing" red card - the red 5. Cathy knows that normally, Bob would think that his red 1 is the red 5 (from *Good Touch Principle*). This must mean that Cathy has the red 5. Cathy writes *Trash Touch Elimination Notes* on her hand for the red 5.
