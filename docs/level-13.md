## Special Moves

<br />

### The Trash Bluff

- Normally, when a trash card is clued, it signifies a *Trash Chop Move* or a *Trash Push*. However, for both of these strategies to work, it is assumed that the recipient of the clue will know that the card that was touched is useless.
- What if the recipient of the clue does **not** know that the card that the clued card is trash? Then, they will go on to misplay that card, mistaking it for a "normal" *Play Clue*.
- If players misrepresent the identity of a trash card in this way, it is a signal for the next person to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card. This is extremely similar to how a *Finesse* or a *Bluff* works (e.g. a clued card has been misrepresented as being immediately playable).
- *Trash Bluffs* are a good tool to get a card played that is sitting behind other annoying cards.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks **except** for the red 1.
  - Cathy has no clued cards in her hand.
  - Alice clues Cathy number 1, which only touches her newest (slot 1) card. This card is a blue 1, but Cathy will assume that it is a red 1.
  - Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card, and it is a playable blue 2.
  - Cathy now knows that her 1 must not be red 1, or else Bob would not have blind-played anything. The 1 must be some other trash card.

<TrashBluff />

- Just like normal *Bluffs*, *Trash Bluffs* can only be done while in *Bluff Seat*.
- Normal *Bluffs* take precedence over *Trash Bluffs*. This means that players can **only** use cards to *Trash Bluff* with if they will be proved to be trash by a blind-play.
  - For example, if not all of the 1's have been played on the stacks, then you can use a number 1 clue to initiate a *Trash Bluff*, because a blind-play will prove that the clued 1 is not a good 1.
  - For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 3, then you **cannot** use a red clue to initiate a *Trash Bluff*, because a blind-play will make the clued card look like the red 5.
  - For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 4, then you can use a red clue to initiate a *Trash Bluff*, because a blind-play will prove that the clued card is not a red 5.
- In the case where multiple cards are clued as part of a *Trash Bluff*, **all** of the touched cards are considered to be trash.

### The Trash Finesse

- In a *Finesse*, we say that the clue "connects" to the blind-play. For example, a blue clue on a blue 2 would connect to a blind-play of blue 1. Or, a number 2 clue on a blue 2 would connect to a blind-play of blue 1.
- In a *Bluff*, we say that the clue does not "connect" to the blind-play. For example, a blue clue on a blue 2 does not connect to a blind-play of a red 1. Or, a number 2 clue on a blue 2 does not connect to the blind-play of a red 2.
- In the *Trash Bluff* example above, a number 1 clue on a blue 1 is used to *Trash Bluff* a blue 2. Similar to a *Bluff*, we would say this number 1 clue does not connect to the blind-play of a blue 2.
- What if a *Trash Bluff* using a number 1 clue instead got a red 1 to blind-play? In this context, the red 1 would actually "connect" to the number 1 clue. Another way of saying this is that by cluing a trash 1 with a number 1 clue, the clue giver is saying that they **see** a matching 1 that is good.
- Thus, it is possible to perform a *Trash Bluff* outside of *Bluff Seat* if the "connecting" card is on someone's *Finesse Position*. When this is done, it promises that someone has that specific card, so we call it a *Trash Finesse* rather than a *Trash Bluff*.
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks except for red 1.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches a blue 1. To Donald, this will look like it is a red 1.
  - At first glance, Bob might think this is a *Trash Bluff*, causing him to blind-play his *Finesse Position* card as either red 1 or some other currently-playable card.
  - However, Bob also sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her *Finesse Position*. Thus, Alice's clue was a *Trash Finesse* instead of a *Trash Bluff*, since it promises a playable 1.
  - Thus, Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card and it is red 1.
  - Donald discards his known-trash 1.

<TrashFinesse />

- In the case where multiple cards are clued as part of a *Trash Finesse*, **all** of the touched cards are considered to be trash. (This is same thing that happens in a *Trash Bluff*.)
- *Double Trash Finesses* are explicitly disallowed. Thus, it is possible to perform a *Trash Finesse* in a situation like this:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks except for red 1 and blue 1.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches two green 1's on slot 1 and 2. To Donald, this will look like it is both the red 1 and the blue 1.
  - Like in the previous example, Bob sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her *Finesse Position*.
  - At first glance, Bob might think that Alice is promising both red 1 and blue 1, which would mean that he would need to blind-play the blue 1.
  - However, a *Trash Finesse* only promises at least one matching card, and since he sees that Cathy has a matching card, then that is good enough. Thus, Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card and it is red 1.
  - Donald knows that the focus of the clue (slot 1) is certainly trash, since that caused Cathy to blind-play.
  - Furthermore, Donald knows that his slot 2 card is also trash, because all the cards touched in a *Trash Bluff* or *Trash Finesse* are guaranteed to be trash.

### The Reverse Trash Finesse

- First, see the section on the *[Trash Finesse](#the-trash-finesse)*.
- It is also possible to perform a *Trash Finesse* in reverse. This is much harder to see than a forward *Trash Finesse*. Even so, players should generally entertain the possibility of this occurring.
- When a clue looks like it could be a *Reverse Trash Finesse*, the player who receives the clue is forced into immediately discarding the card. If it was indeed a *Reverse Trash Finesse*, it will be a trash card and it will immediately demonstrate what is going on. Alternatively, if the clue was a normal *Play Clue* on a playable card, then the discard will be a *Gentleman's Discard*. By discarding, it covers both cases.
- For example, in 3-player game:
  - The red 1 is played on the stacks. All of the 2's are played on the other stacks.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 1 card as a *Play Clue*.
  - From Bob's perspective, this is probably just a *Play Clue* on the red 2 (which happens to be the final 2 that needs to be played).
  - However, Bob sees that Cathy also has a red 2 on her *Finesse Position*. That means that this could be a *Reverse Trash Finesse*.
  - If it is a *Reverse Trash Finesse*, then his 2 is a trash 2 (e.g. green 2). By immediately discarding it, it will prove to Cathy that *she* has a red 2.
  - Alternatively, if Bob does indeed have the red 2, then he can discard it to perform a *Gentleman's Discard* on Cathy.
  - Either way, discarding will cover both cases. Bob discards the 2 and it is revealed to be a green 2.
  - Cathy comes next. Cathy was highly surprised when Alice gave Bob a number 2 clue on the green 2. From Cathy's perspective of Bob's perspective, the green 2 clue would immediately misplay as red 2. However, when Bob discards the green 2 instead of playing it, Alice's plan becomes clear. Cathy had the red 2 all along. Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as red 2.

<ReverseTrashFinesse />

- Note that *Reverse Trash Finesses* should not always be entertained and **depend on context**. Specifically, towards the end of the game, *Reverse Trash Finesses* are "turned off". This is because towards the end of the game, the team needs *Tempo*, and *Reverse Trash Finesses* are slow and require even more discarding.

<br />

### The Trash Push

- Normally, when a useless card is clued, it signifies a *Trash Chop Move*. However, what if the useless card is actually the card on chop? Then it wouldn't be *Chop Moving* anything.
- From *Good Touch Principle*, we know that it is pointless to spend a clue to touch a useless card on someone's chop, because if we just do nothing, the useless card will get automatically discarded.
- Subsequently, if this is done deliberately, it must have a meaning. By doing this, it means that we want to "push" the card that is next to the useless card onto the table.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has no clued cards in his hand. His chop is his slot 5.
  - Alice clues Bob number 1, which only touches his slot 5 card.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 4 card, and it is a playable red 2.

<TrashPush />

- Sometimes, a *Trash Push* is the only way to get a card played that is sitting between two other annoying cards.
- Similar to a *Bluff*, *Trash Pushes* must be immediately playable and should generally be demonstrated immediately. (This is unlike other similar moves like the *5 Pull*, which may have to wait a while.)

## General Principles

<br />

### Clarity Principle

- First, see the section on *[Context](level-11.md#context)*.
- In the H-Group, we like to find the "best" move for every turn in the post-game review. This is fun and helps everybody improve. But this can be taken too far.
- Sometimes, players will give clues that are very complicated. Maybe the clue looks like it could be two different moves. Or, maybe the clue relies on non-obvious contextual factors.
- Often, these kinds of complicated clues end up in misplays and lost games. And in the post-game review, the people who gave the clues get defensive: "if everyone just played perfectly, then my clue would have worked!"
- It's natural for people to feel this way, because normally, if Alice performs a *Finesse*, and Bob is not paying attention and misses it, then we would say that Bob is at fault. But things are a little different when Alice gives a really complicated clue that Bob should *technically* be able to figure out, but doesn't. In this case, Bob shares a little of the blame, but it is mostly Alice that is at fault.
- Part of being good at Hanabi is recognizing when you should **not** try to do the most-optimal clue for the turn, because it would be confusing for your teammates. Clue clarity is really important and you should prioritize it! In the post-game review, you can always say: "On turn X, I considered this more-efficient clue, but it did not seem very clear. So I did this other more-clear clue instead."
- **Don't give confusing clues.** If you do decide to give a confusing clue, and it doesn't work out, then **you are at fault**. This principle is more important than nearly all other principles.
