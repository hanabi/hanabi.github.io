title: Level 16New - Dupe Tech
---

- Level 1 strategies can be learned with no games of Hanabi played. You can either learn them before you play your first game or after you play a few games to learn the basic mechanics.
- This stuff is mostly a repeat of the [beginner's guide](beginner.mdx), but we go into a bit more detail here.
- If you have not read the beginner's guide yet, **STOP NOW** and read that instead. Only come back here after you have played 5-10 games. (This page is just intended to be used as a reference for players who have already read the beginner's guide.)

<br />

## Conventions

<br />

### Chop

- When players have to discard, they typically discard their right-most unclued card.
- A player's chop is formally defined as **the next unclued card that they would discard if they had nothing else to do**.
- If a player has a clued card that is known useless, then they will typically discard the useless card **instead** of discarding their chop. (But the useless card does **not** count as the chop - their chop remains the right-most unclued card.)

<br />

### The Definition of Playable

- First, see the section on _[Delayed Play Clues](beginner/delayed-play-clues.mdx)_ from the beginner's guide.
- When we say that an unclued card is currently _playable_, we do **not** mean that the card would be able to play on the stacks right this instant. If an unclued card is _playable_, then what we really mean is that it would be legal for someone to give either a _Play Clue_ **or** a _Delayed Play Clue_ to the card.
- In other words, if an unclued _playable_ card was given a _Delayed Play Clue_, that card would eventually play on the stack without any additional clues needing to be given by anyone else - all of the in-between cards, if any, would be present and accounted for at the moment that the _Play Clue_ was given.
