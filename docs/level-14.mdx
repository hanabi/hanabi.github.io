## Special Moves

### The Trash Order Chop Move (TOCM)

- First, see the section on the _[Order Chop Move](level-4.mdx#the-order-chop-move-ocm)_.
- Sometimes, a player will have two clued known-trash cards in their hand (and these cards are explicitly known-trash, meaning that everyone on the team can equally see that they are known-trash).
- In this situation, the player is expected to discard the newest (leftmost) trash card.
- Thus, if a player skips over their newest trash card and instead discards the second newest trash card, they must be trying to communicate something extra.
- This means that the next player should _Chop Move_ (in a manner similar to a _Order Chop Move_).
- Note that a player is not necessarily trying to perform a _Trash Order Chop Move_ if the two trash cards have different kinds of clues on them. For example, by discarding specific trash cards, it can communicate that the player "sees" all of the non-trash possibilities of that card.

### The Shout Discard Order Chop Move

- First, see the sections on the _[Shout Discard Chop Move](level-7.mdx#the-shout-discard-chop-move)_ and the _[Trash Order Chop Move](level-14.mdx#the-trash-order-chop-move-tocm)_.
- If a player has a known-playable card and multiple known-trash cards, then discarding a trash card other than the expected trash card causes a skip in exactly the same way as a _Trash Order Chop Move_.
  - As discussed in previous levels, the discard order for trash is from left to right. The exception is with trash that comes from an _Unknown Trash Discharge_ or _Unknown Dupe Discharge_. In that case, the focus is discarded first.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice has a known playable card on slot 1, a known trash card on slot 2, and a known trash card on slot 3.
  - If Alice plays her known playable card from slot 1, nothing special happens.
  - If Alice discards her known trash card from slot 2, it would trigger a _Shout Discard Chop Move_ on Bob.
  - If Alice discards her known trash card from slot 3, it would trigger a _Shout Discard Order Chop Move_ on Cathy.

### The Trash Bluff

- Normally, when a trash card is clued, it signifies a _Trash Chop Move_ or a _Trash Push_. However, for both of these strategies to work, it is assumed that the recipient of the clue will know that the card that was touched is useless.
- What if the recipient of the clue does **not** know that the card that the clued card is trash? Then, they would go on to misplay that card, mistaking it for a "normal" _Play Clue_.
- If players misrepresent the identity of a trash card in this way, it is a signal for the next person to blind-play their _Finesse Position_ card. This is similar to how a _Finesse_ or a _Bluff_ works (in that the clued card has been misrepresented as being immediately playable).
- Additionally, after a _Trash Bluff_, the player who was clued should _Chop Move_ all of the cards to the right of the trash card (similar to how a _Trash Chop Move_ works).
  - If the clued card in a _Trash Bluff_ was already on chop, then nothing extra happens.
  - For level 24 players, an [extra thing happens](level-24.mdx#trash-finesses-and-trash-bluffs-are-always-unnecessary).
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks **except** for the red 1.
  - Cathy has no clued cards in her hand.
  - Alice clues Cathy number 1, which only touches her newest (slot 1) card. This card is a blue 1, but Cathy will assume that it is a red 1.
  - Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card, and it is a playable blue 2.
  - Cathy now knows that her 1 must not be red 1, or else Bob would not have blind-played anything. The 1 must be some other trash card.
  - Additionally, Cathy marks her slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 cards as being _Chop Moved_.

<TrashBluff />

- Just like normal _Bluffs_, _Trash Bluffs_ can only be done while in _Bluff Seat_.
- Normal _Bluffs_ take precedence over _Trash Bluffs_. This means that players can **only** use cards to _Trash Bluff_ with if they will be proved to be trash by a blind-play.
  - For example, if not all of the 1's have been played on the stacks, then you can use a number 1 clue to initiate a _Trash Bluff_, because a blind-play will prove that the clued 1 is not a good 1.
  - For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 3, then you **cannot** use a red clue to initiate a _Trash Bluff_, because a blind-play will make the clued card look like the red 5.
  - For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 4, then you can use a red clue to initiate a _Trash Bluff_, because a blind-play will prove that the clued card is not a red 5.
- In the case where multiple cards are clued as part of a _Trash Bluff_, **all** of the touched cards are considered to be trash.

### The Trash Finesse

- In a _Finesse_, we say that the clue "connects" to the blind-play. For example, a blue clue on a blue 2 would connect to a blind-play of blue 1. Or, a number 2 clue on a blue 2 would connect to a blind-play of blue 1.
- In a _Bluff_, we say that the clue does not "connect" to the blind-play. For example, a blue clue on a blue 2 does not connect to a blind-play of a red 1. Or, a number 2 clue on a blue 2 does not connect to the blind-play of a red 2.
- In the _Trash Bluff_ example above, a number 1 clue on a blue 1 is used to _Trash Bluff_ a blue 2. Similar to a _Bluff_, we would say this number 1 clue does not connect to the blind-play of a blue 2.
- What if a _Trash Bluff_ using a number 1 clue instead got a red 1 to blind-play? In this context, the red 1 would actually "connect" to the number 1 clue. Another way of saying this is that by cluing a trash 1 with a number 1 clue, the clue giver is saying that they **see** a matching 1 that is good.
- Thus, it is possible to perform a _Trash Bluff_ outside of _Bluff Seat_ if the "connecting" card is on someone's _Finesse Position_. When this is done, it promises that someone has that specific card, so we call it a _Trash Finesse_ rather than a _Trash Bluff_.
- Similar to a _Trash Bluff_, a _Trash Finesse_ will also _Chop Move_ all of the cards to the right of the trash card (similar to how a _Trash Chop Move_ works).
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks except for red 1.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches a blue 1. To Donald, this will look like it is a red 1.
  - At first glance, Bob might think this is a _Trash Bluff_, causing him to blind-play his _Finesse Position_ card as either red 1 or some other currently-playable card.
  - However, Bob also sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her _Finesse Position_. Thus, Alice's clue was a _Trash Finesse_ instead of a _Trash Bluff_, since it promises a playable 1.
  - Thus, Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card and it is red 1.
  - Donald discards his known-trash 1. He also marks his slot 3 and slot 4 cards as being _Chop Moved_.

<TrashFinesse />

- In the case where multiple cards are clued as part of a _Trash Finesse_, **all** of the touched cards are considered to be trash. (This is same thing that happens in a _Trash Bluff_.)
- _Double Trash Finesses_ are explicitly disallowed. Thus, it is possible to perform a _Trash Finesse_ in a situation like this:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks except for red 1 and blue 1.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches two green 1's on slot 1 and 2. To Donald, this will look like it is both the red 1 and the blue 1.
  - Like in the previous example, Bob sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her _Finesse Position_.
  - At first glance, Bob might think that Alice is promising both red 1 and blue 1, which would mean that he would need to blind-play the blue 1.
  - However, a _Trash Finesse_ only promises at least one matching card, and since he sees that Cathy has a matching card, then that is good enough. Thus, Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card and it is red 1.
  - Donald knows that the focus of the clue (slot 1) is certainly trash, since that caused Cathy to blind-play.
  - Furthermore, Donald knows that his slot 2 card is also trash, because all the cards touched in a _Trash Bluff_ or _Trash Finesse_ are guaranteed to be trash.

<TrashFinesseTwoCards />

- For level 24 players, there are [additional rules](level-24.mdx#trash-finesses-and-trash-bluffs-are-always-unnecessary) relating to _Trash Finesses_.

### The Reverse Trash Finesse

- First, see the section on the _[Trash Finesse](#the-trash-finesse)_.
- It is also possible to perform a _Trash Finesse_ in reverse. This is much harder to see than a forward _Trash Finesse_. Even so, players should generally entertain the possibility of this occurring.
- When a clue looks like it could be a _Reverse Trash Finesse_, the player who receives the clue is forced into immediately discarding the card. If it was indeed a _Reverse Trash Finesse_, it will be a trash card and it will immediately demonstrate what is going on. Alternatively, if the clue was a normal _Play Clue_ on a playable card, then the discard will be a _Gentleman's Discard_. By discarding, it covers both cases.
- For example, in 3-player game:
  - The red 1 is played on the stacks. All of the 2's are played on the other stacks.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 1 card as a _Play Clue_.
  - From Bob's perspective, this is probably just a _Play Clue_ on the red 2 (which happens to be the final 2 that needs to be played).
  - However, Bob sees that Cathy also has a red 2 on her _Finesse Position_. That means that this could be a _Reverse Trash Finesse_.
  - If it is a _Reverse Trash Finesse_, then his 2 is a trash 2 (e.g. green 2). By immediately discarding it, it will prove to Cathy that _she_ has a red 2.
  - Alternatively, if Bob does indeed have the red 2, then he can discard it to perform a _Gentleman's Discard_ on Cathy.
  - Either way, discarding will cover both cases. Bob discards the 2 and it is revealed to be a green 2.
  - Cathy comes next. Cathy was highly surprised when Alice gave Bob a number 2 clue on the green 2. From Cathy's perspective of Bob's perspective, the green 2 clue would immediately misplay as red 2. However, when Bob discards the green 2 instead of playing it, Alice's plan becomes clear. Cathy had the red 2 all along. Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card as red 2.
  - Because this was a _Trash Finesse_, Bob _Chop Moves_ slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.

<ReverseTrashFinesse />

- Note that _Reverse Trash Finesses_ should not always be entertained and **depend on context**. Specifically, towards the end of the game, _Reverse Trash Finesses_ are "turned off". This is because towards the end of the game, the team needs _Tempo_, and _Reverse Trash Finesses_ are slow and require even more discarding.
- For level 18 players, note that Reverse Trash Finesses can conflict with [Trash Touch Elimination](level-18.mdx#trash-touch-elimination-tte). Specifically, if the represented card satisfies the "1 copy left" rule, then the Reverse Trash Finesse will no longer work and the person with the critical card will write _Trash Touch Elimination Notes_ instead.

### The Forced Gentleman's Discard Chop Move

- First, see the section on the [_Reverse Trash Finesse_](#the-reverse-trash-finesse).
- When a player is forced into performing a _Gentleman's Discard_ that looks like a _Reverse Trash Finesse_, it _Chop Moves_ in the same way that a _Reverse Trash Finesse_ does.
- For example, in the section for the _Reverse Trash Finesse_, Bob is forced into discarding his 2. It turned out to be a green 2, which means that the Alice's clue was a _Trash Finesse_, which means that a _Chop Move_ happens.
- However, in a hypothetical where Bob's 2 turned out to be a red 2, Bob's move would be a _Gentleman's Discard_. But slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 would still be _Chop Moved_ in the same way (even though cards are not normally _Chop Moved_ from a _Gentleman's Discard_).

### The Trash Push

- Normally, when a useless card is clued, it signifies a _Trash Chop Move_. However, what if the useless card is actually the card on chop? Then it wouldn't be _Chop Moving_ anything.
- From _Good Touch Principle_, we know that it is pointless to spend a clue to touch a useless card on someone's chop, because if we just do nothing, the useless card would get automatically discarded.
- Subsequently, if this is done deliberately, it must have a meaning. We agree that this kind of clue "pushes" the new chop card onto the table.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has no clued cards in his hand. His chop is his slot 5.
  - Alice clues Bob number 1, which only touches his slot 5 card.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 4 card, and it is a playable red 2.

<TrashPush />

- Sometimes, a _Trash Push_ is the only way to get a card played that is sitting between two other annoying cards.
- Similar to a _Bluff_, _Trash Pushes_ must be immediately playable and should generally be demonstrated immediately. (This is unlike other similar moves like the _5 Pull_, which may have to wait a while.)

### The Trash Push Prompt & The Trash Push Finesse

- If a player performs a _Trash Push_ on a _one-away-from-playable_ card, it is a signal that someone else has the connecting card as a _Prompt_ or a _Finesse_.
- _Trash Push Prompts_ and _Trash Push Finesses_ cannot be in reverse. In other words, they must fully resolve by the time the clued player gets a turn.
