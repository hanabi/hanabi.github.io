## Conventions

### Known-Trash Discard Order

- Sometimes, players will have two or more clued known-trash cards in their hand. (And everyone on the team can equally see that they are known-trash.)
- In this situation, players are expected to discard the leftmost trash card.
  - For level 16 players, know that the exception to this is if the trash came from an [_Unknown Trash Discharge_](level-16.mdx#the-unknown-trash-discharge-1-for-1-form-utd) or an [_Unknown Dupe Discharge_](level-16.mdx#the-unknown-dupe-discharge-udd). In that case, those cards must be discarded first.

## Special Moves

### The Trash Order Chop Move (TOCM)

- First, see the section on the _[Known-Trash Discard Order](#known-trash-discard-order)_ and the _[Order Chop Move](level-4.mdx#the-order-chop-move-ocm)_.
- If a player skips over their leftmost trash card and instead discards the second leftmost trash card, they must be trying to communicate something extra.
- This means that the next player should _Chop Move_ (in a manner similar to a _Order Chop Move_).
- Note that a player is not necessarily trying to perform a _Trash Order Chop Move_ if the two trash cards have different kinds of clues on them. For example, by discarding specific trash cards, it can communicate that the player "sees" all of the non-trash possibilities of that card.

### The Shout Discard Order Chop Move

- First, see the sections on the _[Shout Discard Chop Move](level-7.mdx#the-shout-discard-chop-move)_ and the _[Trash Order Chop Move](level-14.mdx#the-trash-order-chop-move-tocm)_.
- If a player has a known-playable card and multiple known-trash cards, then discarding a trash card other than the expected trash card causes a skip in exactly the same way as a _Trash Order Chop Move_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice has a known playable card on slot 1, a known trash card on slot 2, and a known trash card on slot 3.
  - If Alice plays her known playable card from slot 1, nothing special happens.
  - If Alice discards her known trash card from slot 2, it would trigger a _Shout Discard Chop Move_ on Bob.
  - If Alice discards her known trash card from slot 3, it would trigger a _Shout Discard Order Chop Move_ on Cathy.

### The Trash Push

- Normally, when a useless card is clued, it signifies a _Trash Chop Move_. However, what if the useless card is actually the card on chop? Then it wouldn't be _Chop Moving_ anything.
- From _Good Touch Principle_, we know that it is pointless to spend a clue to touch a useless card on someone's chop, because if we just do nothing, the useless card would get automatically discarded.
- Subsequently, if this is done deliberately, it must have a meaning. We agree that this kind of clue "pushes" the new chop card onto the table.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - Bob has no clued cards in his hand. His chop is his slot 5.
  - Alice clues Bob number 1, which only touches his slot 5 card.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 4 card, and it is a playable red 2.

<TrashPush />

- Sometimes, a _Trash Push_ is the only way to get a card played that is sitting between two other annoying cards.
- Similar to a _Bluff_, _Trash Pushes_ must be immediately playable and should generally be demonstrated immediately. (This is unlike other similar moves like the _5 Pull_, which may have to wait a while.)

### The Trash Push Prompt & The Trash Push Finesse

- If a player performs a _Trash Push_ on a _one-away-from-playable_ card, it is a signal that someone else has the connecting card as a _Prompt_ or a _Finesse_.
- _Trash Push Prompts_ and _Trash Push Finesses_ cannot be in reverse. In other words, they must fully resolve by the time the clued player gets a turn.

### The Trash Finesse

- Normally, when a trash card is clued, it signifies a _Trash Chop Move_ or a _Trash Push_. However, for both of these strategies to work, it is assumed that the recipient of the clue will know that the card that was touched is useless.
- What if the recipient of the clue does **not** know that the card that the clued card is trash? Then, they would go on to misplay that card, mistaking it for a "normal" _Play Clue_.
- If players misrepresent the identity of a trash card in this way, it is a signal that a player has the originally-promised card on their _Finesse Position_.
- After a _Trash Finesse_, the player who was clued should _Chop Move_ all of the cards to the right of the trash card. (In other words, you can think of a _Trash Finesse_ as both a _Finesse_ and a _Trash Chop Move_ at the same time.)
  - If the clued card in a _Trash Finesse_ was already on chop, then nothing extra happens.
  - For level 24 players, an [extra thing happens](level-24.mdx#trash-finesses-and-trash-bluffs-are-always-unnecessary).
- For example, in a 4-player game:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks except for red 1 and yellow 1.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches a blue 1. To Donald, this will look like it is a red 1 or yellow 1.
  - Bob sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her _Finesse Position_ and, thus, discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card and it is red 1.
  - Donald discards his known-trash 1. He also marks his slot 3 and slot 4 cards as being _Chop Moved_.

<TrashFinesse />

- In the case where multiple cards are clued as part of a _Trash Finesse_, **all** of the touched cards are considered to be trash.
- _Double Trash Finesses_ are explicitly disallowed. Thus, it is possible to perform a _Trash Finesse_ in a situation like this:
  - All the 1's are played on the stacks except for red 1 and blue 1.
  - Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches two green 1's on slot 1 and 2. To Donald, this will look like it is both the red 1 and the blue 1.
  - Like in the previous example, Bob sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her _Finesse Position_.
  - At first glance, Bob might think that Alice is promising both red 1 and blue 1, which would mean that he would need to blind-play the blue 1.
  - However, a _Trash Finesse_ only promises at least one matching card, and since he sees that Cathy has a matching card, then that is good enough. Thus, Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card and it is red 1.
  - Donald knows that the focus of the clue (slot 1) is certainly trash, since that caused Cathy to blind-play.
  - Furthermore, Donald knows that his slot 2 card is also trash, because all the cards touched in a _Trash Finesse_ are guaranteed to be trash.

### The Reverse Trash Finesse

- First, see the section on the _[Trash Finesse](#the-trash-finesse)_.
- It is also possible to perform a _Trash Finesse_ in reverse. This is much harder to see than a forward _Trash Finesse_. Even so, players should generally entertain the possibility of this occurring.
- When a clue looks like it could be a _Reverse Trash Finesse_, the player who receives the clue is forced into immediately discarding the card. If it was indeed a _Reverse Trash Finesse_, it will be a trash card and it will immediately demonstrate what is going on. Alternatively, if the clue was a normal _Play Clue_ on a playable card, then the discard will be a _Gentleman's Discard_. By discarding, it covers both cases.
- For example, in 3-player game:
  - The red 1 is played on the stacks. All of the 2's are played on the other stacks.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 1 card as a _Play Clue_.
  - From Bob's perspective, this is probably just a _Play Clue_ on the red 2 (which happens to be the final 2 that needs to be played).
  - However, Bob sees that Cathy also has a red 2 on her _Finesse Position_. That means that this could be a _Reverse Trash Finesse_.
  - If it is a _Reverse Trash Finesse_, then his 2 is a trash 2 (e.g. green 2). By immediately discarding it, it will prove to Cathy that _she_ has a red 2.
  - Alternatively, if Bob does indeed have the red 2, then he can discard it to perform a _Gentleman's Discard_ on Cathy.
  - Either way, discarding will cover both cases. Bob discards the 2 and it is revealed to be a green 2.
  - Cathy comes next. She was highly surprised when Alice gave Bob a number 2 clue on the green 2. From Cathy's perspective of Bob's perspective, the green 2 would immediately misplay as red 2. However, when Bob discards the green 2 instead of playing it, Alice's plan becomes clear. Cathy had the red 2 all along. Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card as red 2.
  - Because this was a _Trash Finesse_, Bob _Chop Moves_ slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.

<ReverseTrashFinesse />

- _Reverse Trash Finesses_ **must** contain a "potential _Gentleman's Discard_". In other words, it is not possible to perform a _Reverse Trash Finesse_ that causes a matching critical card to blind-play.
  - For level 18 players, this concept is fleshed out more in the [_Trash Touch Elimination_](level-18.mdx#trash-touch-elimination-tte) section, but this is not necessary to understand the rule.
- For example, in 3-player game:
  - The red 1 is played on the stacks. All of the 2's are played on the other stacks. One copy of the red 2 is in the discard pile.
  - Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 1 card as a _Play Clue_.
  - Bob's first thought is that this is a _Play Clue_ on the red 2 (which is the final 2 that needs to be played).
  - However, Bob sees both copies of the red 2. One is in the discard pile and the other is in Cathy's hand. That means that Bob's 2 cannot possibly be the red 2. Thus, Bob knows that this his 2 is trash.
  - Bob discards his 2, understanding that Alice performed a [_Trash Chop Move_](level-4.mdx#the-trash-chop-move-tcm).
  - Cathy was highly surprised when Alice gave Bob a number 2 clue on the green 2. From Cathy's perspective of Bob's perspective, the green 2 would immediately misplay as red 2. However, when Bob discards the green 2 instead of playing it, Cathy knows that something else is happening.
  - Cathy's first thought is that this is a _Reverse Trash Finesse_ (and that she should play the red 2 from her _Finesse Position_).
  - However, Cathy knows that _Reverse Trash Finesses_ must have a _Gentleman's Discard_ component, and it is not possible to _Gentleman's Discard_ a critical red 2. Thus, Cathy just assumes that she has a red 2 somewhere in her hand, and discards.

<ReverseTrashFinesse2 />

- Note that _Reverse Trash Finesses_ should not always be entertained and **depend on context**. Specifically, towards the end of the game, _Reverse Trash Finesses_ are "turned off". This is because towards the end of the game, the team needs _Tempo_, and _Reverse Trash Finesses_ are slow and require even more discarding.

### The Forced Gentleman's Discard Chop Move

- First, see the section on the [_Reverse Trash Finesse_](#the-reverse-trash-finesse).
- When a player is forced into performing a _Gentleman's Discard_ that looks like a _Reverse Trash Finesse_, it _Chop Moves_ in the same way that a _Reverse Trash Finesse_ does.
- For example, in the section for the _Reverse Trash Finesse_, Bob is forced into discarding his 2. It turned out to be a green 2, which means that the Alice's clue was a _Trash Finesse_, which means that a _Chop Move_ happens.
- However, in a hypothetical where Bob's 2 turned out to be a red 2, Bob's move would be a _Gentleman's Discard_. But slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 would still be _Chop Moved_ in the same way (even though cards are not normally _Chop Moved_ from a _Gentleman's Discard_).

### The Trash Bluff

- First, see the section on the _[Trash Finesse](#the-trash-finesse)_.
- In a regular _Bluff_, Alice fibs Bob by pretending he has the connecting card on his _Finesse Position_. According to _Bob's Truth Principle_, Bob must assume Alice is telling the truth and only knows it's a fib after he blind-plays.
- Similarly, in a _Trash Bluff_, Alice clues a trash card, forcing Bob to blind-play his finesse. Bob will assume it's the originally-promised card and only knows it's a fib after he blind-plays.
- Just like a _Trash Finesse_, a _Trash Bluff_ will also _Chop Move_ all of the cards to the right of the trash card.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - All of the 2's are played on the stacks **except** for the red 2.
  - Cathy has no clued cards in her hand.
  - Alice clues Cathy number 2, which touches her slot 2 and slot 4 cards. The card on slot 2 is a blue 2, but Cathy will assume that it is a red 2.
  - Bob blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ card, and it is a playable blue 3.
  - Cathy now knows that her 2 on slot 2 must not be red 2, or else Bob would not have blind-played anything. The 2 must be some other trash card.
  - Additionally, Cathy marks her slot 5 card as being _Chop Moved_.

<TrashBluff />

- Just like normal _Bluffs_, _Trash Bluffs_ can only be done while in _Bluff Seat_.
- Normal _Bluffs_ take precedence over _Trash Bluffs_. This means that players can **only** perform _Trash Bluff_ with cards that will be proved to be trash by a blind-play.
  - For example, if not all of the 1's have been played on the stacks, then you can use a number 1 clue to initiate a _Trash Bluff_, because a blind-play will prove that the clued 1 is not a good 1.
  - For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 3, then you **cannot** use a red clue to initiate a _Trash Bluff_, because a blind-play will make the clued card look like the red 5.
  - For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 4, then you can use a red clue to initiate a _Trash Bluff_, because a blind-play will prove that the clued card is not a red 5.
- For level 24 players, there are [additional rules](level-24.mdx#trash-finesses-and-trash-bluffs-are-always-unnecessary) relating to _Trash Bluffs_.
