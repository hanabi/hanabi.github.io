## Conventions

### Elimination & Elimination Notes

- Normally, your teammates would never let you discard anything important. So when you discard some playable card (or a needed 2) **and** that card is not in anyone else's hand, you might think that the team made a mistake.
- From *High Value Principle*, you should never assume your teammates are making a mistake. One excellent reason that they would let you discard an important card is that you have the other copy in your hand. (In order to satisfy *Good Touch Principle*, they had to wait for you to discard it so that they would not duplicate the card.)
- Thus, when you get a follow-up clue, you will know exactly what card it is.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice discards her chop (slot 5). It is a (playable) red 4.
  - Alice gasps in surprise - she knows that everyone on the team agrees to not let each other discard playable cards (*Save Principle*).
  - Alice knows that the team was not in a dire situation or anything, so the only explanation is that she must have the other copy of the red 4.
  - Alice writes a note of "r4?" on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5. (It can't be on slot 1, since that is the card she just drew.)
  - Bob clues Alice red, which touches a card on slot 1 and slot 2.
  - Normally, Alice would play the left-most card (slot 1) as the red 4. However, because of her notes, she knows that the red 4 must actually be on slot 2.
  - Alice successfully plays red 4 from slot 2. Since the red 5 is the only good red card left, Alice can assume that her other red card is red 5 (from *Good Touch Principle*), and she can play it on the next turn.

<EliminationNotes />

- In this example, the "r4?" notes that Alice writes are called *Elimination Notes*. *Elimination Notes* are notes that represent the possible slots for a specific card.
- In this example, the "thing" that triggered the writing of *Elimination Notes* was the discarding of a card, so this is called *Discard Elimination*.
- Note that players should not always make *Elimination Notes* when they discard a playable card. In some cases, games can be extremely busy, leaving no reasonable way to get the playable card. Players must just their best judgment and account for this.

<br />

### Double Discard Elimination

- When a player who is in a *Double Discard* situation discards anyway with an obvious clue to give (such as a *5 Stall*), it implies that they **see** the other copy of the card, and were not *Double Discarding* at all.
- Thus, when this occurs, you should write *Elimination Notes* on your entire hand for that card.
- This is almost exactly the same thing as *Discard Elimination*, except it is triggered by the discard of a separate player.

### 2 Elimination

- According to *Save Principle*, everyone knows that all of the 2's must get saved. Thus, if someone else on the team lets a 2 get discarded, that is very strange.
- If there is not anything special going on, then this should be a signal that someone else has the other copy of the 2, and should trigger the writing of *Elimination Notes* on their hand.

<br />

## Special Moves

<br />

### The Elimination Blind-Play

- First, see the section on [Elimination](#elimination--elimination-notes).
- In the example for *Discard Elimination*, the team clued the second copy of the red 4 directly. But in other situations, the team will **not** need to clue anything. The player with the *Elimination Notes* can eliminate the possibilities one by one. When there is only one possibility left, they can blind-play the card as an *Elimination Blind-Play*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice discards her chop (slot 5). It is a (playable) red 4.
  - Alice knows that the team was not in a dire situation or anything, so the only explanation is that she must have the other copy of the red 4.
  - Alice writes "r4?" *Elimination Notes* on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5. (It can't be on slot 1, since that is the card she just drew.)
  - Bob clues Alice blue, which touches slots 1, 2, 3, and 4. (This is a *Play Clue* on slot 1.)
  - Alice writes a note of "blue 1" on slot 1.
  - Alice erases her *Elimination Notes* for the red 4 from slots 2, 3, and 4.
  - The only card left with an *Elimination Note* is slot 5.
  - Alice can now blind-play the red 4 when it gets to her turn as an *Elimination Blind-Play*.

<EliminationBlindPlay />

### The Elimination Play Clue

- A clue that touches multiple cards only has one focus. As you probably know, if the chop card was not touched, then the focus is the left-most card.
- However, this rule does not apply if a clue singles out a playable card from *Elimination*. In this case, the card is only focused on the *Elimination* card, and any other cards touched are not necessarily playable right now.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice has both red 2's in her hand on slot 3 and slot 5. (Alice's chop is her slot 5.)
  - Alice discards her chop, and it is revealed to be the red 2.
  - Alice is surprised, and writes *Discard Elimination Notes* for red 2 on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  - Bob gives a number 2 clue to Alice that touches a card in slot 1 and slot 4.
  - Normally, Alice would treat this as a *Play Clue* on the 2 in her slot 1. However, she now knows that her slot 4 card is exactly red 2 (and that she can play it right now).
  - Thus, Alice knows that the point of the clue was only to get the red 2. The 2 in her slot 1 can be any 2 in the game and is not necessarily playable right now.

<EliminationPlayClue />

### Interaction Between Elimination & Chop-Focus

- Sometimes, players will have two or more *Elimination Notes* on cards in their hand. These players can be given follow-up clues that single out the identity of the *Elimination* card.
- Clues can single out the *Elimination* card using *positive information* or by using *negative information*.

#### Example of an Elimination Single-Out Using a Clue With Positive Information

- See the section on the *[Elimination Play Clue](#the-elimination-play-clue)*:
  - In the example for *Elimination Play Clue*, Alice receives a 2 clue.
  - After getting the 2 clue, Alice deletes the *Elimination Notes* on her slot 2, slot 3, and slot 5.
  - Thus, Alice has completely narrowed down the identity of the red 2 to be in slot 4.

#### Example of an Elimination Single-Out Using a Clue With Negative Information

- For example, in 3-player game:
  - Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice discards red 2. She writes *Elimination Notes* for red 2 on slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.
  - Bob clues number 3 to Alice, touching three 3's on slot 2, slot 3, and slot 4.
  - After getting the number 3 clue, Alice deletes the *Elimination Notes* on her slot 2, slot 3, and slot 4.
  - Thus, Alice has completely narrowed down the identity of the red 2 to be in slot 5.

#### Chop-Focus Happens **Before** Clues Are Given

- When a clue is given that singles out an *Elimination* card with *negative information*, then the focus of the clue should be evaluated normally.
- In other words, the focused slot should be evaluated **before** the clue was given, just like how every other clue works.
- For example, continuing on from the previous example:
  - Alice also knows that Bob's number 3 clue must be a *Play Clue* on the red 3 (since red 1 is on the only 1 currently played and there are no 3's in the trash).
  - But which slot is Bob's clue focusing? In other words, which slot is promised to be red 3?
  - The clue is either focused on slot 2 (the newest of the clued cards) or slot 4 (the "new" chop after the red 2 is accounted for).
  - Alice knows that you evaluate where the chop is **before** clues are given, so the clue must be focused on slot 2.

### The Elimination Riding Deduction

- If:
  - there are only two cards left in a player's hand with *Elimination Notes* **and**
  - the previous players let the chop card ride **and**
  - the previous players were not busy, **then**
- The card with the *Elimination Note* card cannot be on the chop! (Otherwise, one of the previous players would have clued it with either a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue* in order to prevent it from being discarded.)
- In such a situation, the player with the *Elimination Notes* can "jump ahead" and immediately blind-play the newest of the two cards.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 has been played on the red stack.
  - Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice discards her chop (slot 5). It is a (playable) red 2.
  - Alice knows that the team was not busy, so she must have the other copy of red 2.
  - Alice writes *Elimination Notes* on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  - Alice receives no clues on the next go-around of the table. She discards, and now has *Elimination Notes* on slots 3, 4, and 5.
  - Alice receives no clues on the next go-around of the table. She discards, and now has *Elimination Notes* on slots 4 and 5.
  - Alice receives no clues on the next go-around of the table. Her teammates would not let the other copy of red 2 be discarded, so it must be on slot 4. Alice blind-plays red 2 from slot 4.

<EliminationRidingDeduction />

### The Riding Bluff

- Typically, when a player has two cards with *Elimination Notes* and the "true" copy of the card is on chop, you must clue it to let them know.
- However, if the other card is also playable, you can choose to not clue anything.
- Next, the player should perform an *Elimination Riding Deduction*, and play the unrelated card.
- After that, there will be only one card left with an *Elimination Note*, so they will go on to play the "true" card on their next turn.

<br />

### The Elimination Self-Chop Move

- Sometimes, you will have narrowed down your *Elimination Notes* to one specific card. Thus, even though the card has no positive clues on it, you know the exact identity of the card.
- If the card in question is on your chop **and** the card is not yet playable **and** you need to discard, you should obviously not discard the important elimination card. You should instead self-chop move and discard the next thing.

<br />

### The Elimination Finesse

- Normally, if a player is *Finessed*, they are supposed to play their *Finesse Position* card. However, what if they have *Elimination Notes* on their hand for the specific card that is *Finessed*?
- In most situations, there will not be an *Elimination Note* on slot 1 (e.g. the *Finesse Position*). This means that playing slot 1 into the *Finesse* would not make any sense.
  - However, in the rare case where there is an *Elimination Note* on their *Finesse Position*, then the player should **still** not play the *Finesse Position*; read on.
- Here, the player is expected to play the **oldest** of the cards with the *Elimination Notes* on them (not counting *Chop Moved* cards, if any).
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Blue 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  - Alice discards a blue 3. Blue 3 was playable, and nothing urgent is currently happening, so she writes *Elimination Notes* on her hand for the other blue 3 on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  - Bob clues Cathy blue, which touches a blue 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  - Cathy discards.
  - Alice knows that this is some sort of *Reverse Finesse*, as it is calling for the blue 3. However, the blue 3 cannot be in her *Finesse Position* (slot 1), as she knows from the *Elimination Notes* that it must be either on slot 2, 3, 4, or 5. So it must instead be a *Reverse Elimination Finesse*.
  - The *Elimination Finesse* promises that it is her oldest card, so she plays slot 5 as blue 3.

<EliminationFinesse />

- As mentioned above, *Chop Moved* cards should be skipped over when finding the *Elimination Finesse* target. If there are two or more cards with *Elimination Notes* on them and they are all *Chop Moved*, then the oldest *Chop Moved* card should be played.
- *Elimination Finesses* apply to **all** types of situations with *Elimination Notes* (including *Double Discard Elimination Notes*). Subsequently, you can more specifically describe an *Elimination Finesse* as a *Discard Elimination Finesse* or a *Double Discard Elimination Finesse*.
- Note that normal *Finesses* take priority over *Self-Elimination Finesses*. For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 2 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice's hand is completely unclued. Alice has *Elimination Notes* on slot 3 and slot 4 for red 3.
  - Cathy clues a number 4 in Alice's slot 1 as a *Self-Finesse*.
  - If Alice's 4 is a blue 4, then this would be a normal *Self-Finesse*, and Alice should blind-play blue 3 from slot 2.
  - If Alice's 4 is a red 4, then this would be an *Elimination Self-Finesse*, and Alice should blind-play red 3 from slot 4.
  - Alice knows that in this situation, you always supposed to assume a normal *Finesse*, so she blind-plays blue 3 from slot 2.

<EliminationFinesse2 />

### Trash Touch Elimination

- After deciding on the target of a clue, players carefully choose between using a color clue and a number clue in order to avoid violating *Good Touch Principle* with the ancillary cards that will be touched (since every clued card is treated as a card that will eventually be played). Sometimes, when both a color clue **and** a number would violate *Good Touch Principle*, players are forced to pick between the lesser of two evils.
- However, sometimes you can see that it **is** possible to use a color or number clue to uniquely touch a clue target without "picking up" extra bad cards. So, when extra bad cards are deliberately touched in this way, it is conveying an extra special message.
- When this occurs and there is exactly one "missing" card, players should write an *Elimination Note* in their hand for the missing card. This is called *Trash Touch Elimination*.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 3 is played on the stacks. All of the other suits have the 1 played on the stacks.
  - Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: red 4, red 1, blue 1, green 1, yellow 1.
  - Alice wants to give a play clue to the red 4. Everyone else on the team (other than Bob) can see that she can give either number 4 or red.
    - If Alice clues number 4, then it will uniquely touch the red 4 (which will satisfy *Good Touch Principle*).
    - If Alice clues red, then it will touch the red 4 and the red 1 (which will **violate** *Good Touch Principle*).
  - Alice clues red to Bob. Since nothing was stopping her from cluing number 4, this is very strange.
  - Bob plays the red 4.
  - There is only one "missing" red card - the red 5. Cathy knows that normally, Bob would think that his red 1 is the red 5 (from *Good Touch Principle*). This must mean that Cathy has the red 5. Cathy writes *Trash Touch Elimination Notes* on her hand for the red 5.
