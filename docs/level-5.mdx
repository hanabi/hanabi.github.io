## Special Moves

<br />

### Prompts in Multi-Color Variants

- In multi-color variants, _Prompts_ apply to the card with the most positive information.
- For example, in a 3-player rainbow game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 4 as a _Play Clue_. This is a _Prompt_ on Bob for a red 3.
  - In slot 1, Bob has a card with only a red clue on it. (Thus, it can be any red card or any rainbow card.)
  - In slot 2, Bob has a card with a red clue and a 3 clue on it. (Thus, it can be red 3 or rainbow 3.)
  - Since slot 2 has more positive information, Bob should choose to play slot 2 as red 3 (instead of slot 1, the left-most card).

<PromptMultiColor />

- Players are **not** supposed to use information from negative clues.
- For example, in a 3-player rainbow game:
  - Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 4 as a _Play Clue_. This is a _Prompt_ on Bob for a red 3.
  - In slot 1, Bob has a card with a positive red clue on it. (Thus, it can be any red card or any rainbow card.)
  - In slot 2, Bob has a card with a positive red clue on it and a negative green clue on it. (Thus, it can be any red card.)
  - Even though slot 2 is technically more likely to be the red 3, Bob knows that players are not supposed to use negative information for determining which card to play into a _Prompt_. Thus, Bob plays the red 3 from slot 1.

### The Hidden Finesse

- Sometimes, you want to _Finesse_ someone with a clued card already in their hand. However, if you try to _Finesse_ them, they will assume it is a _Prompt_ and will play their clued card. Which means that a lot of the time, you can't give a _Finesse_, and must instead clue the card directly.
- However, what if the clued card actually is playable? In that case, you can still do the _Finesse_ - they will play the _Prompted_ card, see that it wasn't the card you had intended, and then blind-play their 2nd newest card on the next turn. This is called a _Hidden Finesse_ because the _Finesse_ was temporarily hidden by the presence of clued card.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Red 1 and rainbow 2 are played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Cathy, which touches her red 3.
  - Bob has a rainbow 3 clued as red in his hand and he has no idea what it is.
  - Bob sees that Alice's clue must be a _Prompt_, so he plays his red card as red 2. He is surprised to see that it is actually rainbow 3.
  - Bob knows that he really must have the red 2, and it must have been on _Finesse Position_ when Alice originally gave the clue. Since he just drew a card after he played the rainbow 3, he now knows that the red 2 is on his slot 2 (the second-newest card).
  - On Bob's next turn, he blind-plays his the red 2 from slot 2.
  - In this example, the red 2 was "hidden" by the rainbow 3.

<br />

### The Layered Finesse

- Normally, a _Finesse_ promises the exact copy of the card on _Finesse Position_. However, as long as all of the cards leading to the card are playable, you can still promise the exact copy of the card. We do **not** consider this to be a _Lie_, since the blind-playing player does indeed have the true copy of the card.
- We call this a _Layered Finesse_ because the intended _Finesse_ blind-play target is "layered" behind other playable cards.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues red to Bob, touching a red 2 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Normally, Bob would think that he has the red 1. However, he also sees that this could be a _Reverse Layered Finesse_ on Cathy. Thus, Bob cannot play anything right now - he must wait and see what Cathy does.
  - Bob does something unrelated.
  - Cathy knows that this is a _Reverse Finesse_ and that she has the red 1. Cathy blind-plays her _Finesse Position_ card. However, it is actually a blue 1, and it successfully plays. Cathy gasps in surprise.
  - Alice does something unrelated.
  - Bob knows that Cathy must have been trying to blind-play a red 1. Thus, he must have the red 2, and Alice did indeed perform a _Layered Finesse_.
  - Bob does something unrelated.
  - Cathy was surprised that she blind-played the blue 1 instead of the red 1. This must be a _Layered Finesse_ and Cathy must really have the red 1. Cathy plays her _Second Finesse Position_ and it is the red 1.

<br />

### The Clandestine Finesse

- To the player who receives a clue that initiates a _Layered Finesse_, it is usually obvious what is going on. For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Alice clues Donald blue, touching one blue card.
  - Bob discards.
  - Cathy blind-plays a green 1.
  - Donald clearly knows that this is a _Layered Finesse_ on Cathy - Cathy will continue to play cards until she finds the blue card that connects to the one in his hand.

<LayeredFinesse2 />

- In other words, most _Layered Finesses_ cause unrelated cards to blind-play that do not connect to the type of clue given.
- With that said, it is also possible to perform a _Layered Finesse_ for unrelated cards that **do** connect to the type of the clue given. When this happens, it is hidden from the receiver of the clue, so we call it a _Clandestine Finesse_ to disambiguate it from a (more obvious) _Layered Finesse_.
- For example, in a 3-player game:
  - Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, which touches the red 3 on slot 2. Thus, the red 3 is the focus of the clue. This must be a _Play Clue_ on the red 3.
  - Bob knows that the red 3 is currently unplayable, so it must be a _Finesse_. He blind-plays his _Finesse Position_ as a red 2. Instead, it is a blue 2, and it successfully plays. Bob gasps in surprise.
  - Normally, Cathy would think that she has the blue 3, because that would connect to the blue 2 that blind-played. (Number 2 connects to number 3.)
  - However, Cathy also sees that Bob had a red 2 on his _Second Finesse Position_ at the time of the clue. So there is a possibility that this was a _Clandestine Finesse_ instead of a normal _Finesse_. Thus, Cathy has to give Bob a chance to blind-play the red 2. If he does not, then Cathy does indeed have the blue 3.
  - Cathy does something unrelated.
  - Alice does something unrelated.
  - Bob was surprised that he blind-played the blue 2 instead of the red 2. This must be a _Clandestine Finesse_ and Bob must really have the red 2.
  - Bob blind-plays his slot 2 card. It is the red 2 and it successfully plays. (Bob knows that if he did not do this, then Cathy would go on to misplay the red 3 as a blue 3.)
  - Cathy plays the red 3.

<br />

### The Stacked Finesse

- If a player has been _Finessed_, then their _Finesse Position_ moves right one slot, exactly like if the blind card was clued. (This is a similar concept to how the chop moves left one slot when a player is _Chop Moved_.)
- If **another** _Finesse_ is performed on the player who has already been _Finessed_, it is stacking a 2nd _Finesse_ on top of the first, and they are expected to blind-play the new _Finesse Position_ card.
- However, because of the possibility of _Layered Finesses_, players should always finish blind-playing cards left-to-right into the older _Finesse_ before starting to blind-play cards into the newer one.
- In rare cases, players can determine that a _Layered Finesse_ was impossible (due to negative clues or some other piece of context). In this situation, if the play order of the cards does not matter, players should always "jump ahead" and play the second card to demonstrate to the team that they "got" both _Finesses_.

<br />

### The Ambiguous Finesse

- Sometimes, the player that is supposed to blind-play a card into a _Finesse_ is ambiguous. For example, in a 4-player game:
  - Nothing is played on the stacks.
  - Alice clues Donald about a red 2 as a _Play Clue_.
  - Both Bob **and** Cathy have red 1 on their _Finesse Position_.
  - Bob will think that it is a _Finesse_ directed at Cathy, and he will discard.
  - Next, Cathy thinks that Bob made a mistake and "missed" the _Finesse_. Cathy discards.

<AmbiguousFinesse />

- Here, Cathy is actually the one making the mistake. It follows from _High-Value Principle_ that you should never assume that your teammates are making a mistake. If Bob is discarding, then it means that Cathy also has the exact same copy of the card, and Cathy should immediately blind-play.

<br />

## General Principles

<br />

### Urgency Principle (Playing Into Finesses as Soon as Possible)

- Normally, when a _Finesse_ occurs, someone blind-plays right away. This is extremely important, because it resynchronizes the information among the team. So, as a group, we agree to **blind-play our cards as soon as reasonably possible**. This is called the _Urgency Principle_.
- Thus, if you see that a player does **not** blind-play into the _Finesse_, then you know that the _Finesse_ must be **on you**.
- However, there are two important exceptions:
  1. Players are allowed to **defer** playing into a _Finesse_ if they are doing a _Finesse_ of their own (and no-one else on the team could have done it).
  1. Players are allowed to **defer** playing into a _Finesse_ if they are doing something really important, like saving a 5 on chop, giving a _Play Clue_ to a card that is about to be discarded, or something along those lines.
- So, if any of the above two conditions apply, then you have to **wait** and give the player yet another turn to demonstrate whether or not they will blind-play.
- For example, in a 5-player game:
  - All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  - There is 1 clue in the bank.
  - Alice clues red to Emily, touching a red 3 as a _Play Clue_. This is a _Finesse_ on the red 2.
  - Bob sees that the _Finesse_ is on Cathy. (Cathy has the red 2 in her _Finesse Position_.) Since the team is at 0 clues, Bob discards.
  - Cathy's knows that Alice is performing a _Finesse_ and that she must have the red 2. Cathy's first instinct is to blind-play the red 2. This is urgent because otherwise, Emily will think that her red card might be the red 2, and it would misplay.
  - However, Cathy also sees that Donald has a blue 5 on chop that needs to be saved. Furthermore, from Cathy's perspective, Donald could discard on his turn, so the blue 5 is in imminent danger. If Cathy blind-plays into the _Finesse_, then the blue 5 might get discarded.
  - Instead of blind-playing into the _Finesse_, Cathy clues number 5 to Donald as a _5 Save_.
  - Since the team is at 0 clues, Donald discards.
  - After Alice's clue, Emily marked her red card as "red 2 or red 3 if Cathy blind-plays red 2". However, even though Cathy did not blind-play the red 2, Emily could see that Cathy was doing an important, time-sensitive action to prevent the team from losing the game. Thus, Emily knows that she needs to give Cathy another chance to blind-play the red 2. If Cathy does not blind-play the red 2 on her next turn (and nothing else special is going on), then Emily can play her own red card as the red 2.

<UrgencyPrinciple />

<br />

### Schrödinger's Cat Principle

- Often times when you are given a clue, the card could be two or more things. For example:
  - In a no-variant game, a red _Play Clue_ might indicate a red 2 or a red 3 depending on whether or not red 2 will blind-play from someone else's hand.
  - In a rainbow-game, a red clue might indicate either a _Play Clue_ on a red 1 or a _Delayed Play Clue_ on a rainbow 2 through another player's yet-to-be-played rainbow 1.
- After getting a clue, you should immediately mark all of the possibilities down on the card as a note.
- For all of your subsequent turns, you have to treat that card like it is **all of the possibilities** at the same time. This is a lot like the _Schrödinger's Cat_ quantum physics analogy, which states a cat is both alive and dead at the same time, and you won't know until you actually open the box and look. Similarly, treat the unknown card as all the possibilities at the same time, and you won't actually know until the card is played.
- The implications of _Schrödinger's Cat Principle_ is that players must be very careful. Before playing a card, they will often have to wait for everyone else to have a turn to allow for the possibility of a _Prompt_, _Reverse Finesse_, and so forth.
