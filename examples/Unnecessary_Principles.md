## Examples of the Unnecessary Principles

### The Unnecessary Trash Finesse Chop Move & The Unnecessary Trash Bluff Chop Move

* The *Trash Finesse* or *Trash Bluff* is almost always done as a last resort - there was no way to give a direct *Play Clue* to the player's *Finesse Position* card without violating *Good Touch Principle*.
* However, sometimes there **is** a way to "cleanly" touch the player's *Finesse Position* card. In this situation, doing a *Trash Finesse* or *Trash Bluff* would be unnecessary. But what if a player does it anyway?
* In this situation, the point of the clue must be to give the clue receiver a safe discard. Thus, the clue receiver should *Chop Move* all of the cards to the right of the trash in the exact same way as a *Trash Chop Move*.
* For example, in a 3-player game, this **would not** be an *Unnecessary Trash Finesse Chop Move*:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks except for the red 2 and the blue 2.
  * Bob has a red 2 on his *Finesse Position* and another red 2 on his chop. Thus, Alice cannot give a red clue to Bob and Alice cannot give a number 2 clue to Bob, since either clue would violate *Good Touch Principle*.
  * Cathy's hand is completely unclued.
  * Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a green 2 on slot 4. (Green 2 is already played and is therefore trash.)
  * Bob blind-plays red 2 from his *Finesse Position*, knowing that this is a *Trash Finesse* or *Trash Bluff*.
  * Cathy knows that her 2 is trash. She also knows that this was likely the only way that Alice could "get" Bob's *Finesse Position* card.
* For example, in a 3-player game, this **would** be an *Unnecessary Trash Finesse Chop Move*:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks except for the red 2.
  * Bob has a red 2 on his *Finesse Position* and no other red cards in his hand. Thus, Alice could give a red clue to Bob in order to "get" the red 2.
  * Cathy's hand is completely unclued.
  * Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a blue 2 on slot 4. (Blue 2 is already played and is therefore trash.)
  * Bob blind-plays red 2 from his *Finesse Position*, knowing that this is a *Trash Finesse* or *Trash Bluff*.
  * Cathy knows that her 2 is trash. However, she also knows that this *Trash Finesse* was unnecessary, as Alice could have just clued red to Bob. Thus, Cathy knows that this is an *Unnecessary Trash Finesse Chop Move*, so she marks her slot 5 card as *Chop Moved*.
* Importantly, *Unnecessary Trash Finesse/Bluff Chop Moves* are tricky in that they have information asymmetry: the player who blind-plays will **not** know that the card is chop moved, while everyone else will. All players will have to keep this in mind until the *Chop Move* has been demonstrated.


### The Unnecessary Unknown Trash Discharge Chop Move (UUTDCM)
If an unnecessary Unknown Trash Discharge is performed, then the player who receives the clue should Chop Move in the same way as the Unnecessary Trash Finesse Chop Move.
Note that this convention only applies if it touches exactly one trash card. (This is because we want players to have the ability to perform 2-for-1 UTDs without promising a Chop Move.)

### The Unnecessary Trash Push

* Normally, players are only allowed to perform a *Trash Push* if the card to "get" cannot be given a direct *Play Clue*. Subsequently, if the card **can** be clued directly, and a *Trash Push* is done anyway, this is very strange.
* In this situation, the very next player should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Bluff*. The receiver of the clue will interpret this as a *Trash Push Finesse* and will then play the pushed card. Once they play it, they will see that it does **not** match, and that an *Unnecessary Trash Push* occurred.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a single 1 on her chop. Since all of the 1's are already played, it is globally known that this must be some kind of *Trash Push*.
  * Bob sees that the pushed card is a red 3. Cathy has no other red cards in her hand, so Alice could have just clued red to Cathy instead of doing a complicated *Trash Push*.
  * Thus, Bob knows that this is an *Unnecessary Trash Push*, and blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is the blue 3 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that this must be a *Trash Push Finesse* on blue 4. Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card, but it is red 3 instead and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy now knows that since the two cards did not match each other, this must have been an *Unnecessary Trash Push*.
* Often times, a (normal) *Trash Push* can provide a player with safe discards that stall out the discard of other useful cards in their hand. If this is the case, then the *Trash Push* would **not** be an *Unnecessary Trash Push*.

* derekcheah plays slot 1 as a *Trash Push*
* Animex52 notices that pianoblook could have clued r3 directly, and also plays slot 1 because of the *Unnecessary Trash Push*

### The Unnecessary Trash Push (Finesse Form)

* First, see the section on the *[Unnecessary Trash Push](#unnecessary-trash-push)*.
* Normally, the *Unnecessary Trash Push* calls for the very next player to blind-play an unrelated card, similar to a *Bluff*.
* However, if the very next player can see that it could be a *Finesse*, then they should prefer that interpretation. This is similar to how the next player should always prefer a *Finesse* interpretation over a *Bluff* interpretation.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a single 1 on her chop. Since all of the 1's are already played, it is globally known that this must be some kind of *Trash Push*.
  * Bob sees that the pushed card is a red 3. Cathy has no other red cards in her hand, so Alice could have just clued red to Cathy instead of doing a complicated *Trash Push*.
  * Thus, Bob knows that this is an *Unnecessary Trash Push*. Normally, Bob would immediately blind-play his *Finesse Position* card. However, Bob also sees that Donald has a red 4 in his *Finesse Position*. Since *Finesses* take precedence over *Bluffs*, Bob knows that he should let Donald be the one to blind-play from the "unnecessaryness".
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy knows that this must be a *Trash Push*. Cathy blind-plays her slot 3 card. It is red 3 instead and it successfully plays.
  * Similar to Bob, Donald also sees that the *Trash Push* was unnecessary. Since Bob did not blind-play anything, this must be an *Unnecessary Trash Push Finesse*. Donald blind-plays his *Finesse Position* as red 4 and it successfully plays.

### Unnecessary Trash Bluff Trash Push
![Example 2 screenshot](../img/examples/unnecessary_principles2.png)
* Dr_Kakashi clues 1 to kimbifille, letting Lilliana play slot 1 as a *Trash Bluff*
* Kyle plays r1
* kimbifille notices that Lilliana's b2 could have been clued directly, and therefore also plays slot 1 as a *Trash Push*

### Unnecessary UTD Trash Push
![Example 3 screenshot](../img/examples/unnecessary_principles3.png)
* Dr_Kakashi clues red to kimbifille, letting Lilliana play b4 as an *Unknown Trash Discharge*
* Kyle sees that black 1 will play, and therefore does not need to play slot 1 as a cancellation blind play
* kimbifille sees that Dr_Kakashi could have easily clued b4 (using rank) and therefore blind plays slot 2 as a *Trash Push*

### Unnecessary Trash Push Finesse Trash Push
![Example 4 screenshot](../img/examples/unnecessary_principles4.png)
* Floriman clues r to scharkbite (green 5 was chop moved earlier), this card is known trash to all
* Kyle plays brown 3 as a *Trash Push Finesse*
* scharkbite plays brown 4 to complete the *Trash Push Finesse*
* pianoblook notices that Floriman could have clued brown 4 directly, which also would have let the same cards play. Therefore pianoblook also plays slot 1 as a *Unnecessary Trash Push Finesse*
