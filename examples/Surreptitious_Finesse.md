- It is the first turn of the game and letical starts.
- letical clues number 3 to Steve, touching the blue 3 as a *Play Clue*.
- The next player is Steve. Steve needs to figure out the meaning of the 3 clue. hanabornoob does not have any playable cards on *Finesse Position*, but Fey does, so Steve knows that this could be a *Reverse Finesse* on one of Fey's cards.
- From Steve's perspective, it could be a few different possibilities:
  - Fey could be blind-playing 0 cards. In that case, it would be a *Double Self-Finesse* on Steve for a 1 and a 2, which means that the 3 could be any 3 in the game. (But Steve has to give a chance for Fey to blind-play first before he should blind-play anything.)
  - Fey could be blind-playing 1 card. In that case, it would be a *Double Finesse* and Steve would have the red 2 on his *Finesse Position*, which means that the 3 would be the matching red 3.
  - Fey could be blind-playing 2 cards. In that case, it would be a *Layered Finesse* and Steve would have the purple 2 on his *Finesse Position*, which means that the 3 would be the matching purple 3.
  - Fey could be blind-playing 3 cards. In that case, it would be a *Layered Finesse* and Steve would not have to blind-play anything, which means that the 3 would be the matching red 3. (Out of all of the possibilities, this is the most likely, since it does not involve Steve blind-playing any cards.)
  - Fey could be blind-playing 4 cards. In that case, it would be a *Surreptitious Finesse* and Steve would have the blue 2 on his *Finesse Position*, which means that the 3 would be the matching blue 3.
- This means that for now, Steve has to wait and see what Fey does. Steve clues green to hanabornoob as a *Play Clue* on the green 1.
- The next player is Fey. Fey knows that she has the blue 1 a *Double Finesse*. She blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card. It is the red 1 and it successfully plays. Fey know knows that a *Layered Finesse* is occurring and that she has the blue 1 on her *Second Finesse Position*.
- On Steve's next turn, he is in the same situation as before. He must give Fey another turn to see if the purple 1 blind-plays or not. Steve does something unrelated.
- Fey blind-plays her *Second Finesse Position*. It is the purple 1 and it successfully plays. Fey know knows that a *Layered Finesse* is still occurring and that she has the blue 1 on her *Third Finesse Position*.
- On Steve's next turn, he is (again) in the same situation as before. He must give Fey another turn to see if the red 2 blind-plays or not. Steve does something unrelated.
- Fey blind-plays her *Third Finesse Position*. It is the red 2 and it successfully plays. At first, this is confusing for Fey, because she realizes that "2" matches "3" and that Steve might now think that he has the red 3 to match. However, Fey knows that a *Surreptitious Finesse* is occurring and that she has the blue 1 on her *Forth Finesse Position*.
- On Steve's next turn, he is (again) in the same situation as before. He must give Fey another turn to see if the blue 1 blind-plays or not. Steve does something unrelated.
- Fey blind-plays her *Forth Finesse Position*. It is the blue 1 and it successfully plays.
- Steve know knows that a *Surreptitious Finesse* is occurring and that he needs to blind-play the blue 2 and that the 3 in his hand is the matching blue 3.
