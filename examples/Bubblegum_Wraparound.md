## Examples of the [Bubblegum Wraparound](../variant-specific/Pink.md#the-bubblegum-wraparound)

#### Example 1

![bubblegum_wraparound](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/examples/bubblegum_wraparound.png)

- It's Zakisan's turn. He wants to do a *Bubblegum Finesse* on TheDaniMan's pink 1 in slot 2 and will.i.am's pink 2 in slot 2. If he gives a 2 clue to will.i.am, it just looks like a normal *Finesse*, and jack67889 might bomb his slot 1 as a pink 1, which is quite bad. Therefore, he gives a 5 clue to will.i.am touching the light pink 2 in slot 2.
- From will.i.am's perspective, it is an *Early 5's Chop Move* since there is something else for Zakisan to do. He *Chop Moves* the black 3 on slot 3 and marks his slot 2 as a 5.
- However, the clue breaks the *Pink Promise* and *Pink Play Clue Lie*. If Zakisan is not making a mistake, then he must be trying to communicate something special. It must a *Bubblegum Finesse*.
- Now, it's TheDaniMan's turn, he doesn't see a pink 1 in someone else's hand, then he knows the *Bubblegum Finesse* is on him. However, it is a 6-player game, no one has the 5th slot to respond to the *Bubblegum Finesse*.
- Thankfully, TheDaniMan also knows the *Bubblegum Wraparound*. If a player does a *Bubblegum Finesse* with a 5, it should be "wraparound" to slot 2. Therefore, he blind-plays his slot 2 as a *Bubblegum Finesse Wraparound*. It is a pink 1 and it successfully plays.
- Now, it's will.i.am's turn, he is surprised by the pink 1 blind-play and realizes it must be a *Bubblegum Finesse Wraparound*. Then he undoes the *Chop Move* on the black 3 and plays the pink 2 from slot 2.

#### Example 2

- The same situation if rz gives a 5 clue to Carunty getting wump's pink 1 from slot 2 and Carunty's pink 2 from slot 2 as a *Bubblegum Finesse Wraparound*.

#### Example 3

- Another example for a 3-player game.
- Sucubis has a known pink 1 which was gotten earlier on slot 2.
- jack67889 gives a 5 clue to Sucubis touching both pink cards on slot 2 and 3. Sucubis plays his pink 1 from slot 2.
- Now, it's XMIL's turn. Since jack67889 broke the *Pink Promise* touching a pink 3 with a 5 clue, it must be a *Reversed Bubblegum Finesse*. However, he doesn't have a pink card on slot 5. This clue doesn't make sense.
- Thankfully, he also knows that the *Bubblegum Finesses* might be "wraparound". If a player does a *Bubblegum Finesse* with a 5, it should be "wraparound" to slot 1 in this situation.
- Therefore, XMIL blind-plays his slot 1 as a *Bubblegum Finesse Wraparound*. It is a pink 1 and it successfully plays.
